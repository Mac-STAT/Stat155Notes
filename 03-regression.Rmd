# Introduction to Regression Models

##Best Fitting Line(s)

Let's return to thought experiment where you were a manufacturer of shirts. 

```{r,echo=TRUE}
bodyfat <- read.delim("http://sites.williams.edu/rdeveaux/files/2014/09/bodyfat.txt")

bodyfat %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Neck, y = Chest)) +
  geom_point(color = 'steelblue') + 
  xlab('Neck size (cm)') + 
  ylab('Chest size (cm)') +
  theme_minimal()
```


If you were to add one or multiple lines to the plot above to help you make business decisions, where would you want it (or them)?

Let's say you were only going to make one size of shirt.  You might want to add a horizontal line at the mean Chest size and a vertical line at the mean Neck size. 

```{r, echo=TRUE}
bodyfat %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Neck, y = Chest)) +
  geom_point(color = 'steelblue') + 
  geom_hline(yintercept = 100.662) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 37.9448) +
  xlab('Neck size (cm)') + 
  ylab('Chest size (cm)') +
  theme_minimal()
```

We can see that this shirt would fit the "average person." However, this might not serve your market very well. For many people, the shirt would be too tight because their chest and/or neck sizes would be larger. For many people, the shirt would be too large because they chest and/or neck sizes would be smaller. 

Let's try something else. Let's allow ourselves 5 different sizes (XS, S, M, L, XL). Then, we can cut the Neck sizes into 5 groups of equal length and estimate the mean Chest sizes within each of these groups. 

```{r, echo=FALSE}
bfmeans <- bodyfat %>%
  mutate(NeckGroups = cut(Neck, 5)) %>%
  group_by(NeckGroups) %>%
  summarize(Means = mean(Chest))

labs <- levels(bfmeans$NeckGroups)
bfmeans <- cbind(bfmeans, lower = as.numeric( sub("\\((.+),.*", "\\1", labs) ),
      upper = as.numeric( sub("[^,]*,([^]]*)\\]", "\\1", labs) ))

bodyfat %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Neck, y = Chest)) +
  geom_point(color = 'steelblue') + 
  geom_segment(aes(x = lower, xend = upper, y = Means, yend = Means),bfmeans)+
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = upper), data = bfmeans) +
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = lower), data = bfmeans) +
  xlab('Neck size (cm)') + 
  ylab('Chest size (cm)') +
  theme_minimal()
```

**What does this tell us?**

What if we wanted to be able to make more sizes? Could we get a pretty good sense of what the chest sizes should be for a given neck size?



```{r, echo=FALSE}
bodyfat %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Neck, y = Chest)) +
  geom_point(color = 'steelblue') + 
  geom_smooth(method = 'lm', se = FALSE) +
  geom_segment(aes(x = lower, xend = upper, y = Means, yend = Means),bfmeans)+
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = upper), data = bfmeans) +
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = lower), data = bfmeans) +
  xlab('Neck size (cm)') + 
  ylab('Chest size (cm)') +
  theme_minimal()
```

**What does this tell us?**

If the scatterplot between two quantitative variables **resembles a straight line**,

- a line could roughly **describe** the mean of Y for each value of X.
- a line could **describe** how much we'd *expect* Y to change based on a 1 unit change in X.
- a line could help us **predict** the Y based on a new value of X.


## Choosing a line

To choose a line, we need to choose the intercept ($b_0$) and slope ($b_1$),

$$ \hat{y} = b_0 + b_1x $$

We have $n$ points on a scatterplot, $(x_i,y_i)$. 

### First idea
Minimize the sum of the **residuals**, $e_i = y_i - \hat{y}_i = y_i - ( b_0 + b_1x_i)$.

- Problem: We will have positive and negative residuals, they will cancel each other out.


### Second idea
Minimize the $\sum_{i=1}^n |y_i - \hat{y}_i| = \sum_{i=1}^n |e_i|$.

- Problem: This is referred to as **Least Absolute Deviations**, but this can result in multiple solutions and is generally a more unstable process (no closed form solution).

### Third idea
Minimize the $\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2= \sum_{i=1}^n e_i^2$.

- This is referred to as **Least Squares** and has a unique solution.

--------

##Least Squares

- Let's find the **minimum of the Sum of Squares Residuals** by searching over a grid for (intercept, slope).
- Surface height is sum of squared residuals for each combination of slope and intercept.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
f <- function(b){
  sum((bodyfat$Chest - (b[1] + b[2] * bodyfat$Neck))^2)
} 
b0 = seq(-20,20,by=.5)
b1 = seq(-10,20,by=1)
b <- expand.grid(b0,b1)
ss <- apply(b,1,f)

persp(b0,b1,matrix(ss,length(b0),length(b1)),theta=65,zlab='Sum of Squares')
```

Imagine the surface height as color (white is lowest). 

```{r, echo=FALSE}
image(b0,b1,matrix(ss,length(b0),length(b1)),col=c('white',topo.colors(100)[100:1]))
```

The large Sum of Square values are dominating this image, so I will change the color scheme to see more variation in smaller values (white is lowest).

```{r, echo=FALSE}
b0 = seq(-10,10,by=.1)
b1 = seq(0,5,by=.1)
b <- expand.grid(b0,b1)
ss <- apply(b,1,f)
image(b0,b1,matrix(log(ss),length(b0),length(b1)),col=c('white',topo.colors(100)[100:1])) #Log Sum of Squares to see variation in lower end
```

We can limit our search to $b_0 \in (-10,10)$ and $b_1 \in (2,3)$
```{r echo=TRUE}
b0 = seq(-10,10,by=.05)
b1 = seq(2,3,by=.05)
b <- expand.grid(b0,b1)
ss <- apply(b,1,f)

b[ss == min(ss),]
```

- Or we could try a numerical optimization technique (such as steepest descent). 
- Or we could use calculus (find partial derivatives, set equal to 0, and solve).

If you find the minimum (via calculus), you'll find that we can write the Least Squares solution in a closed-form (as functions of summary statistics!),

$$ b_1  = r\frac{s_y}{s_x}$$

and

$$ b_0 = \bar{y} - b_1\bar{x} $$

where $\bar{x}$ is the mean of the variable on the x-axis, $\bar{y}$ is the mean of the variable on the y-axis, $s_x$ is the standard deviation of the variable on the x-axis, $s_y$ is the standard deviation of the variable on the y-axis, and $r$ is the correlation coefficient between the two variables.

```{r echo=TRUE}
sy = sd(bodyfat$Chest)
sx = sd(bodyfat$Neck)
r = cor(bodyfat$Chest,bodyfat$Neck)
ybar = mean(bodyfat$Chest)
xbar = mean(bodyfat$Neck)

(b1 = r*sy/sx)
(b0 = ybar - b1*xbar)

lm(Chest~Neck, data = bodyfat)
```


--------

##Properties of Least Squares Line

- $(\bar{x},\bar{y})$ is on the line. 

- Least squares residuals add to 0.

- The standard deviation of the residuals gives us a sense of how bad our predictions (based on the line) could be. 

$$s_e = \sqrt{\frac{\sum^n_{i=1} (y_i-\hat{y}_i)^2}{n-2}}  = \sqrt{\frac{\sum^n_{i=1} e_i^2}{n-2}} $$

In R: $s_e$ is called the "residual standard error"

```{r echo=TRUE}
summary(lm(Chest~Neck, data = bodyfat))
tidy(lm(Chest~Neck, data = bodyfat))
```

So, based on this line, we can predict your chest size within 5 to 10 inches. 

**If you were a shirt manufacturer, what would you do with this information?**

Let's see how some real companies create shirts,

rect(17*2.54,46*2.54,17.5*2.54,48*2.54,col='red')
```

##Interpretation

Let's look at the summary of the lm() in R again.

```{r echo=TRUE}
summary(lm(Chest~Neck, data = bodyfat))
```

Least Squares/Regerssion Line ($\hat{y} = b_0 + b_1x$)

- The line gives the estimated average of y for each value of x (**within observed range of x**)
- Example: The regression line of (Predicted Chest = -3.1 + 2.7Neck) gives the estimated average Chest size for a give Neck size, based on our sample of data. 

Intercept ($b_0$)

- The intercept gives the average value of y when x is zero (**think about context**)
- Example: If Neck size = 0, then the person doesn't exist. In this context, the intercept doesn't make much sense to interpret. 


Slope ($b_1$)

- The slope gives the change in average y for 1 unit increase in x (**not for individuals and not causal**)
- Example: If we consider a neck size 1 cm larger, then we'd expect the average chest size to increase by about 2.7cm.


###Correlation or Association v. Casuation

In order to say that an increase in X **will lead** to an increase in Y (causal effect), we need to control for all other possible variables that could impact both X and Y (**confounding variables**).

- In order to prove a causal relationship (X causes Y), you need to keep everything *(and I mean everything)* the same or as similar as possible except the difference in X. 



##Evaluation

Let's consider another data example. Can I predict your college GPA based on your high school GPA? (Disclaimer: not Macalester data)


```{r echo=TRUE}
sat <- read.csv("Data/sat.csv")
```

```{r echo=TRUE}
sat %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = high_GPA, y = univ_GPA)) +
  geom_point(color = 'steelblue') +
  geom_smooth(method = 'lm', se = FALSE) +
  xlab('HS GPA') +
  ylab('College GPA') + 
  theme_minimal()
```

First things first. Describe the scatterplot. 

- Direction: positive relationship (higher high school GPA is associated with higher college GPA)
- Form: generally linear
- Strength: There is a weak relationship when high school GPA < 3.0 (r = .32) and a fairly strong relationship when high school GPA > 3.0 (r = .68). 
- Unusual: As seen with the strength, there is increased variability in college GPA among individuals with lower high school GPA. That variability decreases with increased high school GPA. We call this pattern of unequal variation as "thickening."



```{r echo=TRUE}
sat %>%
  mutate(HighHSGPA = high_GPA > 3) %>%
  group_by(HighHSGPA) %>%
  summarize(Cor = cor(high_GPA,univ_GPA))
```

Let's build a model to predict college GPA based on high school GPA. Since we noted that there was a linear relationship, let's find the least squares/regression line.

```{r echo=TRUE}
lm.gpa <- lm(univ_GPA ~ high_GPA, data = sat)
summary(lm.gpa)
```

The best fitting line is (Predicted College GPA = 1.09 + 0.675High School GPA). 

Let's plug in a few values.

- High School GPA = 2: Predicted College GPA = 1.09 + 0.675*2 = 2.44

```{r echo=TRUE}
1.09 + 0.675*2
predict(lm.gpa, newdata = data.frame(high_GPA = 2))
```

- High School GPA = 3.5: Predicted College GPA = 1.09 + 0.675*3.5 = 3.45

```{r echo=TRUE}
1.09 + 0.675*3.5
predict(lm.gpa, newdata = data.frame(high_GPA = 3.5))
```

- High School GPA = 4.5: Predicted College GPA = 1.09 + 0.675*4.5 = 4.13

```{r echo=TRUE}
1.09 + 0.675*4.5
predict(lm.gpa, newdata = data.frame(high_GPA = 4.5))
```

Does it make sense to use this model for high school GPA's > 4.5?  Some high schools have a max GPA of 5.0 due to weighting of advanced courses. 

- What is the maximum high school GPA in this data set? 
- What if your college doesn't allow for GPA's above 4.0? 


```{r echo=TRUE}
sat %>%
  summarize(max(high_GPA))
```

Making predictions beyond the observed range of values is called **extrapolation** and is generally a risky thing to do. If you extrapolate beyond the minimum or maximum of the observed values, then you are assuming that the relationship you observe can be extended into the new prediction range. This is that main issue of **forecasting**, making predictions in the future. You have to assume that the trend that you observe now will continue in the future and that the current state of affairs will stay the same.

###Prediction Errors

If the residuals were approximately unimodal and symmetric, we expect about 95% of the residuals to be within 2 standard deviations of 0 (the mean residual). 

```{r echo=TRUE}
hist(residuals(lm.gpa))
```

```{r echo=TRUE}
SSE = sum(residuals(lm.gpa)^2)
n = (length(residuals(lm.gpa)))
s = sqrt(SSE/(n-2))
s
2*s
```

So I can predict your GPA within about $0.5$ GPA points. Is this useful? 


```{r echo=TRUE}
sd(sat$univ_GPA)
2*sd(sat$univ_GPA)
```

Without knowing your high school GPA, we could have guessed within $\pm 0.9$.  That was based on the sum of squared total variation,

$$ SSTO = \sum{(y_i -\bar{y})^2} $$

SSTO is the numerator of the standard deviation of $y$ (without knowing anything about $x$).

```{r echo=TRUE}
(SSTO = sum((sat$univ_GPA - mean(sat$univ_GPA))^2))
```



###$R^2$

Let's study the reduction in the unexplained variation (residuals from a linear regression model -- with $x$ v. the original deviations from the mean -- without $x$). 

```{r, echo=FALSE}
gpavar = data.frame(resids = c(residuals(lm.gpa), sat$univ_GPA-mean(sat$univ_GPA)), type = rep(c('Linear Model Residuals','Original Deviations from Mean'), each = nrow(sat)))

gpavar %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = type, y = resids)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```




We started with the sum of the deviations from the mean $SSTO = \sum{(y_i - \bar{y})^2}$ before we had info about high school GPA ($x$).

- Now, with our knowledge of $x$, we have $SSE = \sum{(y_i - \hat{y_i})^2}$

- $SSE$ should be smaller than $SSTO$ (!)

Two extreme cases: 

  * If the error (SSE) goes to zero, we'd have a "perfect fit". 
  
  * If $SSE = SSTO$, $x$ has told us nothing about $y$.

- So we define:
$$ R^2 = 1 - \frac{SSE}{SST} = 1 - \frac{ \sum{(y_i - \hat{y_i})^2}}{ \sum{(y_i - \bar{y})^2}}$$

```{r echo=TRUE}
1 - SSE/SSTO
glance(lm.gpa) #r.squared = R^2, sigma = s_e (ignore the rest)
```

- $R^2$ can be interpreted as the *fraction* or *percent* of the total variation in $y$ "accounted for" by the model in $x$. 

- Is there a "good" value of $R^2$? Same answer as correlation -- no.

- $R^2$ doesn't tell you the direction or the form of the relationship.

- Note: $R^2 = r^2$ for simple linear models (one x variable).

---


##Diagnostics

Residuals are what's left over from a linear fit. We can actually learn a lot by studying what is left over. INSERT SCATOLOGY JOKE. 

What do we need for a simple linear model to make sense?

  * Variables are both **Quantitative**
  
  * Relationship is **Straight Enough**
  
  * There are extreme **Outliers** 
  
  * Spread is roughly same throughout -- the **Does the Plot Thicken?** condition
  
To check these we look at the original scatterplot and a plot of *residuals* vs. *predicted values*,

```{r echo=TRUE}
augment(lm.gpa, data = sat) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = .fitted, y = .resid)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0) +
  theme_minimal()
```

What do you think?

  * Is there any pattern? (Is the original scatterplot straight enough?)
  * Is there equal spread across prediction values?

We want to avoid extreme outliers because points that are both far from the mean of x and do not fit the overall relationship have **leverage** to change the line.

```{r}
x = runif(50,0,10)
y = rnorm(50)
dat = data.frame(x,y)
dat %>%
  ggplot(aes(x,y)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method='lm') + 
  xlim(0,20) + 
  ylim(-5,10) + 
  theme_minimal() 

x = c(x,20)
y = c(y,10)
dat = data.frame(x,y)

dat %>%
  ggplot(aes(x,y)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method='lm') + 
  xlim(0,20) + 
  ylim(-5,10) + 
  theme_minimal() 
```

###Solutions to Issues

* Problem: Both variables are NOT **Quantitative**
- If you have the x-variable is categorical, we'll turn it into a quantitative variable using **indicator variables** (coming up) 
- If you have a binary variable (exactly 2 categories) that you want to predict, we'll use **logistic regression** (coming up)

* Problem: Relationship is NOT **Straight Enough**
- If the plot does not thicken, we can add higher degree terms to the model (**multiple linear regression** - coming up)
- If the plot does thicken, see solutions below.

* Problem: Spread is NOT roughly same throughout
- You may be able to transform the y-variable using mathematical functions ($log(y)$, $y^2$, etc.) to make the spread more consistent (one approach is **Box-Cox** -- take more statistics classes to learn more)
- Be careful in interpreting the standard deviation of the residuals

* Problem: You have **extreme outliers**
- Look into the outliers. Determine if they could be due to human error. Think carefully about them, dig deep.
- Do a sensitivity analysis: Fit a model with and without the outlier and see if your conclusions drastically change (see if those points had leverage).

##Multiple Linear Regression

A linear model can include many explanatory variables (X's):

$$\hat{y}_i = b_0 + b_1x_{i1} + \cdots + b_kx_{ik}$$

- Each coefficient $b_j$ can be interpreted as the increase in the predicted/average y associated with a 1 unit increase in $x_j$, **keeping all other variables constant**. (\*There are some exceptions - we'll get there)

- These X's can be 
    - Quantitative variables (or transformations of them)
    - Indicator variables for categorical variables (only need $k-1$ indicators for variable with $k$ categories)
    - Interaction terms (product of two variables, which allows for *effect modification*)
    
Let's talk about home prices. We want to build a model to predict the price of a home based on its many characteristics. Here we have a data set of homes recently sold in New England with many variables such as the age of the home, the land value, whether or not it has central air conditioning, the number of fireplaces, the sale price, and more...

```{r echo=TRUE}
homes <- read.delim('http://sites.williams.edu/rdeveaux/files/2014/09/Saratoga.txt')
head(homes)
```

\*The exception to the interpretation comment above is if our variables are strongly correlated.


###Indicator Variables

In New England, fireplaces are often used as a way to heat the house. Let's study the impact of a fireplace has on the sale price of a home. In particular, we only care if the home has 1 or more fireplaces or no fireplaces.

```{r echo=TRUE}
homes <- homes %>%
  mutate(AnyFireplace = Fireplaces > 0)
```

In order to include this information in our model, we need to turn that categorical variable ( AnyFireplace, TRUE or FALSE) into an **indicator variable**,

$$ 1_{AnyFireplaceTRUE} = \begin{cases}1 \quad \text{ if a home has at least one fireplace}\\ 0\quad \text{ if a home does not have a fireplace} \end{cases}$$
In fact, R creates this indicator for you when you put a categorical variable as an X variable in the model.

```{r echo=TRUE}
lm.home <- lm(Price ~ AnyFireplace, data = homes)
tidy(lm.home)
```

So what does this mean? Let's think about two types of homes: a home with one or more fireplaces and a home without a fireplace.

- Home with fireplace: Predicted Price = 174653.35 + 65260.61*1 = $239,914

```{r echo=TRUE}
174653.35 + 65260.61*1
```
- Home without fireplace: Predicted Price = 174653.35 + 65260.61*0 = $174,653.35


The difference between these predicted prices is \$65,260.61. So is this how much a fireplace is worth? If I installed a fireplace in my house, should the value of my house go up \$65,260?

- No, because we are not making causal statements based on observational data. What could be confounding this relationship? What third variable may be related to both the price and whether or not a house has a fireplace?

Let's look at the size of the house. Is price related to the area of living space (square footage)?

```{r echo=TRUE}
homes %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Living.Area, y = Price)) + 
  geom_point(color = 'steelblue') +
  theme_minimal()
```

Is presence of a fireplace related to are of living space?

```{r echo=TRUE}
homes %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = AnyFireplace, y = Living.Area)) + 
  geom_boxplot() +
  theme_minimal()
```

Let's put Living.Area in the model along with AnyFireplace.

```{r echo=TRUE}
lm.home2 <- lm(Price ~ AnyFireplace + Living.Area, data = homes)
tidy(lm.home2)
```

What does this mean? Let's think about two types of homes: a home with one or more fireplaces and a home without a fireplace.

- Home with fireplace: Predicted Price = 13599.16 + 5567.37\*1 + 111.21\*Living.Area = \$19166.53 + \$111.21\*Living.Area

```{r echo=TRUE}
13599.16 + 5567.37*1
```
- Home without fireplace: Predicted Price = 13599.16 + 5567.37\*0 + 111.21\*Living.Area = \$13599.16 + \$111.21\*Living.Area



If we keep Living.Area constant by considering two equally sized homes, then we'd expect the home with the fireplace to be worth \$5567.37 more than a home without a fireplace. 

We see this by taking the difference between the two equations, Predicted Price (with Fireplace) - Predicted Price (without Fireplace) = (\$19166.53 + \$111.21\*Living.Area) - ( \$13599.16 + \$111.21\*Living.Area) = \$19166.53 - \$13599.16 = \$5567.37.

- Note this was the estimated coefficient for AnyFireplaceTRUE. 

- So the \$5567.37 is the increase in the predicted/average Price associated with a 1 unit change in AnyFireplace (TRUE or FALSE), **keeping all other variables (Living.Area) constant**.

- Similarly, we could reason out that \$111.21 is the increase in the predicted/average Price associated with a 1 square footage increase in Living.Area,**keeping all other variables (AnyFireplace) constant**.

Let's look back at the relationship between Living.Area and Price and color the scatterplot by AnyFireplace. The model with AnyFireplace and Living.Area results in two lines, with different intercepts but the same slope (parallel lines). 

```{r echo=TRUE}
homes %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Living.Area, y = Price, color = AnyFireplace)) + 
  geom_point() +
  theme_minimal()
```

Let's try and fit two separate lines to these two groups of homes, home with any fireplaces and home with no fireplaces. Do these lines have the same intercepts? Same slopes?

```{r echo=TRUE}
homes %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Living.Area, y = Price, color = AnyFireplace)) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = 'lm', se = FALSE) +
  theme_minimal()
```

In this case, it look as though having a fireplace in your house changes the relationship between Living.Area and Price. In fact, having a fireplace in your house, the increase in your price for every 1 square foot is greater than that for homes without fireplaces (slopes are different).


###Interaction Variables

We can actually allow for different slopes within one model. 

- If we add a variable in the model as is, it only changes the intercept.


- If we want different slopes such that we believe that the value of a variable, $x_1$, impacts the effect of another, $x_2$, on Y such that
$$b_2 = a + bx_1$$ 
then we allow for **effect modification**,
$$\hat{y} = b_0 + b_1x_{1} + b_2x_{2}= b_0 + b_1x_{1} + (a+bx_1)x_{2}= b_0 + b_1x_{1} +ax_2+bx_1x_{2} $$
using an **interaction term,** which is the product of two variables.

Let's do that with our housing data.


```{r echo=TRUE}
lm.home3 <- lm(Price ~ AnyFireplace*Living.Area, data = homes)
tidy(lm.home3)
```

What does this mean? Let's think about two types of homes: a home with one or more fireplaces and a home without a fireplace.

- Home with fireplace: Predicted Price = 40901.29 + -37610.41\*1 + 92.36391\*Living.Area + 26.85\*Living.Area\*1 = \$3,290.88 + \$119.21\*Living.Area

```{r echo=TRUE}
40901.29 + -37610.41*1
92.36391 + 26.85*1
```
- Home without fireplace: Predicted Price = 40901.29 + -37610.41\*0 + 92.36391\*Living.Area + 26.85\*Living.Area\*0 = \$40,901.29 + \$92.36\*Living.Area

We see a different slopes and different intercepts for these two groups. 



###Conditions for Multiple Linear Regression

- Relationships between each quantitative $X$'s and $Y$ are **straight enough** (check scatterplot's and residual plot)
- About **equal spread** of residuals across fitted values (check residual plot)
- No extreme outliers (points far away in X's can have **leverage** to change the line)

####Is the Difference Real? Is this the True Relationship?

We could also ask, is this the true relationship between Living Area and Price?

```{r echo=TRUE}
lm.home4 <- lm(Price ~ Living.Area, data = homes) 
summary(lm.home4)
```

If we ask ourself this question, we are assuming a few things:

1. We would like to make a general statement about a **population of interest**.

2. We don't have data for everyone in our population (we don't have a **census**).

3. Depending on who ends up in our **sample**, the relationship/difference/estimate may change a bit.

4. We want to know how much the relationship/difference/estimate may change based on **sampling variation.**  

- Let's treat our sample (of size $n$) as our 'fake' population (since we don't have the full population).
    - Randomly sample from our sample (with replacement) a new sample of size $n$
- Calculate the least squares line.
- Repeat.

```{r echo=TRUE}
boot <- do(1000)*lm(Price ~ Living.Area, data = resample(homes))

boot %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Living.Area)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  xlab('Bootstrap Slopes')
```

This is called **Bootstrapping** and it is used to 1) measure the variability in estimates (slope in this case) between random samples and 2) provide an interval of plausible values for the estimate (slope in this case).  

Let's first look at the variability of the slopes across the bootstrap samples. The standard deviation of the slopes will be similar to the std.error from the linear model output.

```{r}
boot %>%
  summarize(sd(Living.Area))#this is going to be of similar magnitude to the Std Error in output
tidy(lm.home4)
```

To get an interval of plausible values, we look at the histogram and take the middle 95%. The lower end will be the 2.5th percentile and the upper end will be the 97.5th percentile.

```{r}
boot %>%
  summarize(lower = quantile(Living.Area, 0.025), upper = quantile(Living.Area, 0.975))
```

# Preface {-}

For Math 155, we will spend our time in-class working together on real problems, asking each other questions, and expanding our understanding of the material. 

This online text is a collection of notes that includes definitions of concepts, data examples, and R code. Together, the will support our discussion in class. 

This is a living document, which will get updated throughout the semester. Based on your feedback, we will adjust chapters to clarify concepts for when you reflect back on previous material.

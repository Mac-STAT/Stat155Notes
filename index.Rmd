# Introduction

For Math 155, we will spend our time in-class working together on real problems, asking each other questions, and expanding our understanding of the material. 

This online text is a collection of notes that includes definitions, examples, and will support our discussion in class. 

If you find any typos or have questions, please email bheggese@macalester.edu.

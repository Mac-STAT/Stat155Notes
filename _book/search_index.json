["introduction-to-data.html", "Chapter 2 Introduction to Data", " Chapter 2 Introduction to Data We live in a data-driven world. From search engines to satellite images, from cell phones to credit cards, current technology can produce data faster than we can analyze them. Our goal in Statistics is to get information from this data. The main way we do this is by visually exploring the data and building models to try to explain observed variability, while staying grounded in the context of the data. "],
["data-context.html", "2.1 Data Context", " 2.1 Data Context For any data set, you should always ask yourself (or others) a few questions to provide vital context about a data set. Who is in the data set? (What is the observational unit or case? How were they selected?) What is being measured or recorded on each case? (What are the characteristics or variables that were collected?) Where were they collected? (One location? Multiple locations?) When were they collected? (One point in time? Over time?) How were they collected? (Measurements? Questionnaire? By phone? In person?) Why were they collected? (Who paid? Conflicts of interest?) "],
["sampling.html", "2.2 Sampling", " 2.2 Sampling We hope that the cases in the data set are representative of a population of interest. In particular, we say that our data that has been collected is a sample from a population. Population of Interest: A collection of people, creatures, things, cases or others that we interested in knowing more about. Sample: A subset of the population of interest on which we have collected data. Getting information from everyone individual in a population is very difficult (it is called a census) and in many situations, impossible. We want to get a sense of the population by just collecting data on a subset. Consider the process of making a soup. We want to make sure there is enough (but not too much) salt in the soup. We don’t need or want to eat the entire pot of soup to test if there is the right amount. In fact, we just need a spoonful from a well-stirred pot of soup so that the taste is representative of the whole pot. What would happen if we put the salt in but didn’t stir? What if we taste just the top layer of the soup from the pot? It would be overly salty. But just below the surface, there would be too little. In order for our sample taste to be useful to us, we need to ensure that it is representative of the whole. Representative Sample: A group that closely matches the characteristics of its population as a whole. In other words, the sample is a fairly accurate reflection of the population from which the sample is drawn. 2.2.1 Sampling Bias If we do not have a representative sample due to the way individuals were selected to be in the study, then we say that there was bias in the sampling process (this is known as sampling bias). (Think about putting your spoon only on the edge or only in the middle, while not stirring.) Sampling Bias: If the sample is unrepresentative of the population of interest in a systematic way, there is sampling bias. Here are a few flavors of sampling bias: Undercoverage: When some members of the population are inadequately represented in the sample due to the sampling procedure (often from convenience samples). An example would be the Literary Digest 1936 poll that got the presidental election wrong. The survey relied on a convenience sample, drawn from telephone directories and car registration lists. In 1936, people who owned cars and telephones tended to be more affluent. Response bias: When the recorded response does not accurately represent the true value for the individual due to wording of the question or to increase social desirability. Most people like to present themselves in a favorable light, so they will be reluctant to admit to unsavory attitudes or characteristics or illegal activities in a survey, particularly if survey results are not confidential. Nonresponse bias: When individuals chosen or selected for the sample are unwilling or unable to participate. An example would be an unreturned mail survey that is only sent to a random set of individuals. Voluntary response bias: When the individuals in the sample are self-selected volunteers (they were not chosen or selected by a researcher). An example would be call-in radio shows that solicit audience participation in surveys on controversial topics (abortion, affirmative action, gun control, etc.). 2.2.2 Random Sampling To avoid some of these types of sampling bias, we may want to “stir the pot before taking a taste” by taking a random sample from the population so as to make sure the sample is representative of the population. Note that randomizing the sampling procedure doesn’t eliminate bias (especially nonresponse bias). We can take actions to try to maximize the response rate by repeatedly requesting a response (calling, emailing, going in person, etc). Random Sampling: A procedure for sampling from a population in which (a) the selection of a sample unit is based on chance and (b) every element of the population has a known, non-zero probability of being selected. Random sampling helps produce representative samples by eliminating voluntary response bias and guarding against undercoverage bias. There are many ways to do random sampling. A few flavors are: Simple Random Sampling: A simple random sample involves having a list of all of the units of a population of interest (called a sampling frame) and then randomly selecting units without replacement. In doing so, every unit has an equal chance of being selected and every sample of size \\(n\\) has an equal chance of being selected. Stratified Sampling: A stratified sampling allows you to control the characteristics of the sample by first taking the sampling frame and separating the units into homogenous groups based on a chosen set of characteristics (ex. gender, major of study). Then you do a simple random sample within each homogenous groups, controlling the number selected from each group. Cluster Sampling: A cluster sampling is often done for the sake of time and financial constraints and involves taking the sampling frame and separate the units into hetereogeneous groups, typically defined by physical locations, and then a simple random sample is completed on the groups, meaning that a heterogeneous group is randomly selected and every member in that group is in the sample. Systematic Sampling: Systematic sampling involves selecting individuals from the list of units in the population, the sampling frame, by first chooing a random starting point and then selecting all kth individuals in the list. The interval must be fixed ahead of time. Before you choose your starting point, everyone has the same chance of being selected. "],
["observational-study-vs-experiments.html", "2.3 Observational Study vs. Experiments", " 2.3 Observational Study vs. Experiments Data can be collected in one of two scenerios: Observational Study: Data is collected in such a way such that the researcher does not manipulate or intervene in characteristics of the individuals. Researchers simply observed or record characteristics of the sample through direct measurement or through a questionnaire or survey. Experiment: Data is collected in such a way such that the researcher does manipulate or intervene characteristics of the individuals by randomly assigning individuals to treatment and control groups. Researchers then record characteristics of the individuals in the sample within the treatment and control groups. The main reason for doing an experiment is to try to estimate a relationship between a treatment and a response without the impact of confounding variables. For example, imagine we want to know if taking a daily multivitamin reduces systolic blood pressure. If we did an observational study, we’d select a sample (hopefully randomly) from a population of interest and then ask whether an individual takes a daily multivitamin and measure their blood pressure. Would this data be enough evidence to conclude that vitamin use causes a reduction in blood pressure? No, it wouldn’t. Individuals that take daily multivitamins may also be more health-conscious and thus eat more fruits and vegetables and exercise, which could be related to blood pressure. The diet and exercise would be acting as confounding variables, making it impossible to say for certain if vitamin use has a direct impact on blood pressure. Confounding Variables: Third variables that are related to both a “treatment” (e.g. multivitamin) and a “response” (e.g. blood pressure). For example, say we note that higher ice creams sales is related to a higher number of pool drownings. What could be a confounding variable in this circumstance? In an experiment, we “manipulate” the characteristics of an individual by randomly assigning them to a treatment group. This random assignment is intended to break the relationship between any third variable and the treatment so as to try to reduce the impact of confounding. It is impossible to entirely remove the possibility of confounding, but the random assignment to a treatment helps. (Note: things can get complicated if individuals don’t comply with the treatment such as take the multivitamin every single day…) Causal Inference: Causal inference is the process of making a conclusion about direct cause and effect between a “treatment” and a “response”. It is very difficult to make causal inferences/statements based on data from an observational study due to the possible presence of confounding variables. There is a whole area of statistics dedicated to methods that attempt to overcome the confounding, but that is beyond the scope of this course. (If you want a “gentle” but mathematical introduction to this area of Statistics, I’d suggest reading “Causal Inference in Statistics: A Primer” by Judea Pearl, Madelyn Glymour, Nicholas P. Jewell) "],
["tidy-data.html", "2.4 Tidy Data", " 2.4 Tidy Data Raw data can come in a variety of formats. In order to analyze the data, we need to get data into a tidy format, in which Rows represent cases (one row per observational unit – this could be an individual or an individual at a particular time) Columns represent variables (one column per characteristic) Variables can be either categorical or quantitative variables. Categorical variable: A characteristic with values that are names of categories; the names of categories could be numbers such as with zipcodes. If the categories have a natural ordering, it could be called an ordinal variable, but we won’t be distinguishing between different types of categorical variables in this class. Quantitative variable: A characteristic with measured numerical values with units. Note: Any quantitative variable can be converted into a categorical variable by creating categories defined by intervals or bins of values. "],

["visualizing-data.html", "Chapter 3 Visualizing Data", " Chapter 3 Visualizing Data The first step in any data analysis is to visually explore your data. There is a saying that “a picture is worth a 1000 words.” In making visualizations, our goal is to quickly and easily get a better understanding of the variability and relationships that exist in the data. Here we will cover the standard appropriate graphics for univariate variation and bivariate relationships. The choice of the graphic depends on the type(s) of variable(s): quantitative or categorical. So the first step is to think about the variables you are interested in visualizing and determining whether they are quantitative or categorical. For each type of variable, we will use a real data set to illustrate the visualizations. "],
["one-categorical-variable.html", "3.1 One Categorical Variable", " 3.1 One Categorical Variable First, we consider survey data of the electoral registrar in Whickham in the UK (Source: Appleton et al 1996). Survey was conducted in 1972-1974 to study heart disease and thyroid disease (baseline characteristics: age and smoking status) A follow-up on those in the survey was conducted twenty years later (followup characteristics: mortality after 20 years) Let’s first consider the age distribution. Age, depending on how it is measured, could act as a quantitative variable or categorical variable. In this case, age is a quantitative variable because it is recorded to the nearest year. But, for illustrative purposes, I’m going to create a categorical variable by separating age into intervals. What do I lose when I convert a quantitative variable to a categorical variable? What do I gain? 3.1.1 Bar Plot The height of the bars is the only part that encodes the data (width is meaningless). The height can either represent the frequency (count of cases) or the relative frequency (proportion of cases). data(Whickham) #load data set from package Whickham &lt;- Whickham %&gt;% mutate(ageCat = cut(age, 4)) #Create a new categorical variable with 4 categories based on age (equal length of age intervals) Whickham %&gt;% count(ageCat) %&gt;% mutate(relfreq = n / sum(n)) ## # A tibble: 4 x 3 ## ageCat n relfreq ## &lt;fct&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 (17.9,34.5] 408 0.311 ## 2 (34.5,51] 367 0.279 ## 3 (51,67.5] 347 0.264 ## 4 (67.5,84.1] 192 0.146 Whickham %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = ageCat)) + geom_bar(fill=&quot;steelblue&quot;) + xlab(&#39;Age Categories in Years&#39;) + ylab(&#39;Counts&#39;) + theme_minimal() What do you notice?

The relative heights show conditional distributions (frequencies within subsets), but it is hard to compare distributions between bars because the overall heights differ. Distribution: the way something is spread out (aka the way in which values vary).

What do you wonder? Gut Check: How is it that our conclusions are exactly the opposite if we consider the relationship between smoking and mortality within age subsets? This is called Simpson’s Paradox, which is a situation in which you come to two different conclusions if you look at results overall versus within subsets (e.g. age groups). Let’s look at the marginal distribution of smoking status within each age group. For groups of people that were 68 years of age or younger, it was about 50-50 in terms of smoker vs. non smoker. But, the oldest age group were primarily nonsmokers. Now look at the mortality rates within each age category. The 20-year mortality rate among young people (35 or less) was very low but that increases with increased age. So the oldest age group had the highest mortality rate, due primarily to their age, and also had the highest rate of non-smokers. So when we look at everyone together (not subsetting by age), it looks like smoking is associated with a lower mortality rate, when in fact age was just confounding the relationship between smoking status and mortality.

How many modes do you see? Center: Where is a typical value located? Spread (or variation): How spread out are the values? (Concentrated around one or more values or spread out?) Also, we ask: Are there any unusual features such as outliers or gaps? Why? Here is another data set for comparison: CEO salaries for the highest paid CEOs in 2016 (Source: NYTimes). nyturl &lt;- &#39;https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/05/26/business/highest-paid-ceos.html?mcubz=0&#39; dat &lt;- read_html(nyturl) ceo &lt;- dat %&gt;% html_nodes(&quot;.nytg-compensation , .nytg-year&quot;) %&gt;% html_text() %&gt;% str_replace(&#39;\\\\$|-&#39;,&#39;&#39;) #webscraping data ceo &lt;- data.frame(matrix(ceo,ncol = 2,byrow = TRUE)) names(ceo) &lt;- c(&#39;year&#39;,&#39;salary&#39;) ceo$salary &lt;- as.numeric(ceo$salary) ceo &lt;- ceo %&gt;% filter(year == &#39;2016&#39;) #Highest Paid CEO&#39;s in the U.S. in 2016 (Source: NYTimes) ceo %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = salary)) + geom_histogram(aes(y = ..density..), binwidth = 15, fill = &quot;steelblue&quot;) + geom_density(alpha = 0.2, fill = &quot;steelblue&quot;) + xlab(&#39;Salary ($M)&#39;) + ylab(&#39;Counts&#39;) + theme_minimal() 3.3.2 Center For center, we have some choices for numerically summarizing it: Mean: The sum of the values divided by the number of values (sample size), \\(\\bar{y} = \\frac{\\sum^n_{i=1}y_i}{n}\\) Sensitive to outliers, but efficiently uses all the data Median: The “middle” value. The number for which half of the values are below and half are above.

Also, let’s add the mean (red dashed), median (blue dotted), and 5% trimmed mean (purple dash-dot). What would the boxplot look like if all of the values were exactly the same? 3.3.4 Spread For spread we have several choices to numerically describe it: Range: the maximum value - the minimum value Sensitive to the outliers since it’s the difference of the extremes IQR: the interquartile range : Q3 - Q1 (75th percentile - 25th percentile). Length of the box in a boxplot Spread of middle 50% of data Like the median. Less sensitive because it doesn’t use all of the data Standard deviation: Root mean squared deviations from mean, \\(s_y = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sum^n_{i=1}(y_i-\\bar{y})^2}{n-1}}\\) Roughly the average size of deviation from the mean (\\(n-1\\) instead of \\(n\\)) Uses all the data but very sensitive to outliers and skewed data (large values are first squared). diff(range(NHANES$SleepHrsNight, na.rm = TRUE)) #range gives max and min; take difference ## [1] 10 IQR(NHANES$SleepHrsNight, na.rm = TRUE) #Q3-Q1 ## [1] 2 sd(NHANES$SleepHrsNight, na.rm = TRUE) #standard deviation ## [1] 1.346729 diff(range(ceo$salary)) ## [1] 156 IQR(ceo$salary) ## [1] 59.25 sd(ceo$salary) ## [1] 39.05955 x = rnorm(1500) boxplot(x, horizontal = TRUE, xlab = &quot;Generated Data&quot;) abline(v = range(x), col = &quot;blue&quot;, lty = 3) abline(v = quantile(x, c(0.25, 0.75)), col = &quot;purple&quot;, lty = 1) abline(v = c(-sd(x), sd(x)), col = &quot;green&quot;, lty = 2) What percentage of the data is between the blue dotted lines (length of interval is range)? What percentage of the data is between the purple solid lines (length of interval is IQR)? What percentage of the data is between the green dashed lines (length of interval is 2*SD)? sum(x &gt; -sd(x) &amp; x &lt; sd(x))/length(x) ## [1] 0.686 3.3.5 Z-scores How do you decide when an outlier is really unusual (think: athletic victory being very impressive or a data point that may be an error)? If the observation is far from the rest of the measurements in the data, we tend to say that the value is more unusual. We want to quantify this idea of “unusual.” To do this, we often calculate a z-score, a standardized data value. Calculate how far the observation was below (or above) the mean of the sample. Then divide the difference by the standard deviation (measure of spread). \\[ z = \\frac{y - \\bar{y}}{s_y}\\] The z-score just tells you how many standard deviations the observation is above or below the mean. Say that you got a z = 1 on an exam with mean = 80 and sd = 5. That means that you got an 85 on the exam (\\(mean + z*sd = 80 + 1*5\\)). If you got a z = -2 on an exam with mean = 80 and sd = 5, that means you got a 70 on the exam (80 + -2*5). In general, it is quite common to have z-scores between -3 and 3, but very unusual to have them greater than 3 or less than -3. In particular, if you have a unimodal, symmetric distribution z-score values will be between -1 and 1 about 68% of the time, between -2 and 2 about 95% of the time, and between -3 and 3 about 99.7% of the time. For those of you who like mathematical theorems, go check out Chebyshev’s inequality. It gives a mathematical reasoning for why z-scores of magnitude 3 or greater are very unusual. Then take probability to get an even better understanding of it! In summary, for a quantitative variable, Use a histogram to display the distribution of one variable and describe the shape and any unusual features. For “well behaved” distributions (symmetric, unimodal, no outliers), use the mean and standard deviation to describe the center and spread. Then z-scores will roughly follow the 68-95-99.7 rule stated above. For others, use the IQR and median. You can report both mean and median, but it’s usually a good idea to state why. "],

Then, we can cut the Neck sizes into 5 groups of equal length and estimate the mean Chest sizes within each of these groups. What does this tell us? What if we wanted to be able to make more sizes? Could we get a pretty good sense of what the chest sizes should be for a given neck size? What does this tell us? If the scatterplot between two quantitative variables resembles a straight line, a line could roughly describe the mean of Y for each value of X. a line could describe how much we’d expect Y to change based on a 1 unit change in X. a line could help us predict the Y based on a new value of X.

Here we have a data set of homes recently sold in New England with many variables such as the age of the home, the land value, whether or not it has central air conditioning, the number of fireplaces, the sale price, and more… homes &lt;- read.delim(&#39;http://sites.williams.edu/rdeveaux/files/2014/09/Saratoga.txt&#39;) head(homes) ## Price Lot.Size Waterfront Age Land.Value New.Construct Central.Air ## 1 132500 0.09 0 42 50000 0 0 ## 2 181115 0.92 0 0 22300 0 0 ## 3 109000 0.19 0 133 7300 0 0 ## 4 155000 0.41 0 13 18700 0 0 ## 5 86060 0.11 0 0 15000 1 1 ## 6 120000 0.68 0 31 14000 0 0 ## Fuel.Type Heat.Type Sewer.Type Living.Area Pct.College Bedrooms ## 1 3 4 2 906 35 2 ## 2 2 3 2 1953 51 3 ## 3 2 3 3 1944 51 4 ## 4 2 2 2 1944 51 3 ## 5 2 2 3 840 51 2 ## 6 2 2 2 1152 22 4 ## Fireplaces Bathrooms Rooms ## 1 1 1.0 5 ## 2 0 2.5 6 ## 3 1 1.0 8 ## 4 1 1.5 5 ## 5 0 1.0 3 ## 6 1 1.0 8 *The exception to the interpretation comment above is if our variables are strongly correlated. 4.8.1 Indicator Variables In New England, fireplaces are often used as a way to heat the house. Let’s study the impact of a fireplace has on the sale price of a home. In particular, we only care if the home has 1 or more fireplaces or no fireplaces. homes &lt;- homes %&gt;% mutate(AnyFireplace = Fireplaces &gt; 0) In order to include this information in our model, we need to turn that categorical variable ( AnyFireplace, TRUE or FALSE) into an indicator variable, \\[ 1_{AnyFireplaceTRUE} = \\begin{cases}1 \\quad \\text{ if a home has at least one fireplace}\\\\ 0\\quad \\text{ if a home does not have a fireplace} \\end{cases}\\] In fact, R creates this indicator for you when you put a categorical variable as an X variable in the model. lm.home &lt;- lm(Price ~ AnyFireplace, data = homes) tidy(lm.home) ## # A tibble: 2 x 5 ## term estimate std.error statistic p.value ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 (Intercept) 174653. 3419. 51.1 0. ## 2 AnyFireplaceTRUE 65261. 4522. 14.4 1.17e-44 So what does this mean? Let’s think about two types of homes: a home with one or more fireplaces and a home without a fireplace. Home with fireplace: Predicted Price = 174653.35 + 65260.61*1 = $239,914 174653.35 + 65260.61*1 ## [1] 239914 Home without fireplace: Predicted Price = 174653.35 + 65260.61*0 = $174,653.35 The difference between these predicted prices is $65,260.61. So is this how much a fireplace is worth? If I installed a fireplace in my house, should the value of my house go up $65,260? No, because we are not making causal statements based on observational data. What could be confounding this relationship? What third variable may be related to both the price and whether or not a house has a fireplace? Let’s look at the size of the house. Is price related to the area of living space (square footage)? homes %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = Living.Area, y = Price)) + geom_point(color = &#39;steelblue&#39;) + theme_minimal() Is presence of a fireplace related to are of living space? homes %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = AnyFireplace, y = Living.Area)) + geom_boxplot() + theme_minimal() Let’s put Living.Area in the model along with AnyFireplace. lm.home2 &lt;- lm(Price ~ AnyFireplace + Living.Area, data = homes) tidy(lm.home2) ## # A tibble: 3 x 5 ## term estimate std.error statistic p.value ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 (Intercept) 13599. 4992. 2.72 6.51e- 3 ## 2 AnyFireplaceTRUE 5567. 3717. 1.50 1.34e- 1 ## 3 Living.Area 111. 2.97 37.5 2.20e-225 What does this mean? Let’s think about two types of homes: a home with one or more fireplaces and a home without a fireplace. Home with fireplace: Predicted Price = 13599.16 + 5567.37*1 + 111.21*Living.Area = $19166.53 + $111.21*Living.Area 13599.16 + 5567.37*1 ## [1] 19166.53 Home without fireplace: Predicted Price = 13599.16 + 5567.37*0 + 111.21*Living.Area = $13599.16 + $111.21*Living.Area If we keep Living.Area constant by considering two equally sized homes, then we’d expect the home with the fireplace to be worth $5567.37 more than a home without a fireplace. We see this by taking the difference between the two equations, Predicted Price (with Fireplace) - Predicted Price (without Fireplace) = ($19166.53 + $111.21*Living.Area) - ( $13599.16 + $111.21*Living.Area) = $19166.53 - $13599.16 = $5567.37. Note this was the estimated coefficient for AnyFireplaceTRUE. So the $5567.37 is the increase in the predicted/average Price associated with a 1 unit change in AnyFireplace (TRUE or FALSE), keeping all other variables (Living.Area) constant. Similarly, we could reason out that $111.21 is the increase in the predicted/average Price associated with a 1 square footage increase in Living.Area,keeping all other variables (AnyFireplace) constant. Let’s look back at the relationship between Living.Area and Price and color the scatterplot by AnyFireplace. The model with AnyFireplace and Living.Area results in two lines, with different intercepts but the same slope (parallel lines). homes %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = Living.Area, y = Price, color = AnyFireplace)) + geom_point() + theme_minimal() Let’s try and fit two separate lines to these two groups of homes, home with any fireplaces and home with no fireplaces. Do these lines have the same intercepts? Same slopes? homes %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = Living.Area, y = Price, color = AnyFireplace)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = &#39;lm&#39;, se = FALSE) + theme_minimal() In this case, it look as though having a fireplace in your house changes the relationship between Living.Area and Price. In fact, having a fireplace in your house, the increase in your price for every 1 square foot is greater than that for homes without fireplaces (slopes are different). 4.8.2 Interaction Variables We can actually allow for different slopes within one model. If we add a variable in the model as is, it only changes the intercept. If we want different slopes such that we believe that the value of a variable, \\(x_1\\), impacts the effect of another, \\(x_2\\), on Y such that \\[b_2 = a + bx_1\\] then we allow for effect modification, \\[\\hat{y} = b_0 + b_1x_{1} + b_2x_{2}= b_0 + b_1x_{1} + (a+bx_1)x_{2}= b_0 + b_1x_{1} +ax_2+bx_1x_{2} \\] using an interaction term, which is the product of two variables. Let’s do that with our housing data. lm.home3 &lt;- lm(Price ~ AnyFireplace*Living.Area, data = homes) tidy(lm.home3) ## # A tibble: 4 x 5 ## term estimate std.error statistic p.value ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 (Intercept) 40901. 8235. 4.97 7.47e- 7 ## 2 AnyFireplaceTRUE -37610. 11025. -3.41 6.61e- 4 ## 3 Living.Area 92.4 5.41 17.1 1.84e-60 ## 4 AnyFireplaceTRUE:Living.Area 26.9 6.46 4.16 3.38e- 5 What does this mean? Let’s think about two types of homes: a home with one or more fireplaces and a home without a fireplace. Home with fireplace: Predicted Price = 40901.29 + -37610.41*1 + 92.36391*Living.Area + 26.85*Living.Area*1 = $3,290.88 + $119.21*Living.Area 40901.29 + -37610.41*1 ## [1] 3290.88 92.36391 + 26.85*1 ## [1] 119.2139 Home without fireplace: Predicted Price = 40901.29 + -37610.41*0 + 92.36391*Living.Area + 26.85*Living.Area*0 = $40,901.29 + $92.36*Living.Area We see a different slopes and different intercepts for these two groups. 4.8.3 Conditions for Multiple Linear Regression Relationships between each quantitative \\(X\\)’s and \\(Y\\) are straight enough (check scatterplot’s and residual plot) About equal spread of residuals across fitted values (check residual plot) No extreme outliers (points far away in X’s can have leverage to change the line) Interactive Visualization: http://omaymas.github.io/InfluenceAnalysis/ 4.8.3.1 Is the Difference Real? Is this the True Relationship? We could also ask, is this the true relationship between Living Area and Price? lm.home4 &lt;- lm(Price ~ Living.Area, data = homes) summary(lm.home4) ## ## Call: ## lm(formula = Price ~ Living.Area, data = homes) ## ## Residuals: ## Min 1Q Median 3Q Max ## -277022 -39371 -7726 28350 553325 ## ## Coefficients: ## Estimate Std.

We don’t have data for everyone in our population (we don’t have a census). Depending on who ends up in our sample, the relationship/difference/estimate may change a bit. We want to know how much the relationship/difference/estimate may change based on sampling variation. Let’s treat our sample (of size \\(n\\)) as our ‘fake’ population (since we don’t have the full population). Randomly sample from our sample (with replacement) a new sample of size \\(n\\) Calculate the least squares line. Repeat. boot &lt;- do(1000)*lm(Price ~ Living.Area, data = resample(homes)) boot %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = Living.Area)) + geom_histogram() + xlab(&#39;Bootstrap Slopes&#39;) ## `stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`. This is called Bootstrapping and it is used to 1) measure the variability in estimates (slope in this case) between random samples and 2) provide an interval of plausible values for the estimate (slope in this case). Let’s first look at the variability of the slopes across the bootstrap samples. The standard deviation of the slopes will be similar to the std.error from the linear model output. ## sd(Living.Area) ## 1 3.601931 ## # A tibble: 2 x 5 ## term estimate std.error statistic p.value ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 (Intercept) 13439. 4992. 2.69 7.17e- 3 ## 2 Living.Area 113. 2.68 42.2 9.49e-268 To get an interval of plausible values, we look at the histogram and take the middle 95%.

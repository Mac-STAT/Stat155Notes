# Visualizing Data

The first step in any data analysis is to visually explore your data. 

There is a saying that "a picture is worth a 1000 words." In making visualizations, our goal is to quickly and easily get a better understanding of the variability and relationships that exist in the data. 

Here we will cover the standard appropriate graphics for univariate variation and bivariate relationships. We will also cover techniques for multivariate relationships (3 or more variables). The choice of the graphic depends on the type(s) of variable(s): quantitative or categorical. So the first step is to think about the variables you are interested in visualizing and determining whether they are quantitative or categorical.

For each type of variable, we will use a real data set to illustrate the visualizations.

## Good Visualization Principles

Before we discuss the standard graphics, let's lay out the basic design principles for good data visualizations.

1. **Show the Data** This may be self-explanatory, but make sure that the data is the focus and driver of the visualization. 

2. **Avoid Distorting the Data** Avoid 3D charts as the added dimension distorts the comparison. The areas in a graph should equal the magnitude of the data it is representing.

3. **Simplify** In 1983, Edward Tufte said that "A large share of ink on a graphic should present data-information, the ink changing as the data change. Data-ink is the non-erasable core of a graphic, the non-redundant ink arranged in response to variation in the numbers represented." Remove any unnecessary ink that does not assist the presentation of the data. Remove distractions.

4. **Facilitate Comparisons** In order to explain variation, we want the graphics to facilitate comparisons between groups. The design should make it easier to compare between groups rather than harder. 

5. **Use Contrast** Humans have developed to seek out visual contrast. When choosing colors and annotation, strive for more contrast in luminance (white to dark) to make it easier for others to visually perceive. 

6. **Use Color Appropriately** Think about your audience. A small proportion of the population is color-blind; try printing it in grayscale to see if it is still effective. Also, every culture has different associations with colors; ask others for feedback on color choices. Neuroscience research has shown that humans are more sensitive to red and yellow, so those are good colors to use for highlighting key points. 

7. **Annotate Appropriately** Informative text is crucial for providing data context. Make sure to use informative axis labels and titles. It may be worth adding text to explain extreme outliers.

For examples of good data visualizations in the news, check out the New York Times column ["What's Going on in This Graph?"](https://www.nytimes.com/column/whats-going-on-in-this-graph).


## Anatomy of a ggplot command

In this course, we'll largely construct visualizations using the `ggplot` function from the `ggplot2` R package. NOTE: `gg` is short for "grammar of graphics". Plots constructed from the `ggplot` function are constructed in layers, and the syntax used to create plots is meant to reflect this layered construction. As you read through the rest of this chapter, pay attention to how the syntax generally follows this structure:

```{r eval=FALSE}
data %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = X_AXIS_VARIABLE, y = Y_AXIS_VARIABLE)) +
    VISUAL_LAYER1 +
    VISUAL_LAYER2 +
    VISUAL_LAYER3 + ...
```

The visual layers are features such as points, lines, and panels. The `+`'s allow us to add layers to build up a plot.


## One Categorical Variable

First, we consider survey data of the electoral registrar in Whickham in the UK (Source: Appleton et al 1996). A survey was conducted in 1972-1974 to study heart disease and thyroid disease and a few baseline characteristics were collected: age and smoking status. 20 years later, a follow-up was done to check on mortality status (alive/dead).

Let's first consider the age distribution of this sample. Age, depending on how it is measured, could act as a quantitative variable or categorical variable. In this case, age is recorded as a quantitative variable because it is recorded to the nearest year. But, for illustrative purposes, let's create a categorical variable by separating age into intervals.

**Distribution:** *the way something is spread out (aka the way in which values vary).*

```{r}
require(dplyr)
data(Whickham) #load data set from Whickham package

Whickham <- Whickham %>%
    mutate(ageCat = cut(age, 4)) #Create a new categorical variable with 4 categories based on age (equal length of age intervals)

head(Whickham)
```

```{block, type="reflect"}
What do I lose when I convert a quantitative variable to a categorical variable? What do I gain?
```

### Bar Plot

One of the best ways to show the distribution of one categorical variable is with a bar plot. For a bar plot, 

- The **height** of the bars is the only part that encodes the data (width is meaningless). 
- The height can either represent the **frequency** (count of cases) or the **relative frequency** (proportion of cases).


```{r}
## Numerical summary (frequency and relative frequency)
Whickham %>%
    count(ageCat) %>%
    mutate(relfreq = n / sum(n)) 

## Graphical summary (bar plot)
Whickham %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = ageCat)) + 
    geom_bar(fill="steelblue") + 
    xlab('Age Categories in Years') + 
    ylab('Counts') + 
    theme_minimal()
```

```{block type='reflect'}
What do you notice? What do you wonder?
```

### Pie Chart

Pie charts are only useful if you have 2 to 3 possible categories and you want to show relative group sizes. 

This is the best use for a pie chart:

```{r, out.width = '.25\\textwidth', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("Photos/pie.jpg")
```

We are intentionally not showing you how to make a pie chart because a bar chart is a better choice. 

Here is a good summary of why many people strongly dislike pie charts: http://www.businessinsider.com/pie-charts-are-the-worst-2013-6. Keep in mind Visualization Principle #4: Facilitate Comparisons. We are much better at comparing heights of bars than areas for slices of a pie chart.


## Two Categorical Variables

Now, let's consider two other variables in the same Whickham data set. What is the relationship between the 20-year mortality outcome and smoking status at the beginning of the study?

### Side by Side Bar Plot

There are a few options for visualizing the relationship between two categorical variables. One option is to use a bar plot and add bars for different categories next to each other, called a **side-by-side bar plot**. For these plots,

- The **height** of the bars shows the frequency of the categories within subsets.

```{r}
## Numerical summary (frequency and overall relative frequency)
Whickham %>%
  count(outcome, smoker) %>%
  mutate(relfreq = n / sum(n))

## Graphical summary (side-by-side bar plot)
Whickham %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = smoker, fill = outcome)) + 
  geom_bar(position = position_dodge()) + 
  xlab('Smoker Status') + 
  ylab('Counts') + 
  scale_fill_manual('20 Year Mortality', values = c("steelblue", "lightblue")) + 
  theme_minimal()
```

```{block type='reflect'}
What do you notice? What do you wonder?
```

### Stacked Bar Plot

Another way to show the same data is by stacking the bars on top of each other with a category. For a **stacked bar plot**,

- The **height** of the entire bar shows the **marginal distribution** (frequency of the X variable, ignoring the other variable).
- The **relative heights** show **conditional distributions** (frequencies within subsets), but it is hard to compare distributions between bars because the overall heights differ.
- The **widths** of the bars have no meaning.


```{r}
## Numerical summary (conditional distribution - conditioning on outcome)
Whickham %>%
    count(outcome, smoker) %>%
    group_by(outcome) %>%
    mutate(relfreq = n / sum(n)) 

## Numerical summary (conditional distribution - conditioning on smoker)
Whickham %>%
    count(outcome, smoker) %>%
    group_by(smoker) %>%
    mutate(relfreq = n / sum(n)) 

## Graphical summary (stacked bar plot)
Whickham %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = smoker, fill = outcome)) + 
    geom_bar() + 
    xlab('Smoker Status') + 
    ylab('Counts') + 
    scale_fill_manual('20 Year Mortality',values=c("steelblue", "lightblue")) + 
    theme_minimal()
```

```{block type='reflect'}
What do you notice? What do you wonder?
```

### Stacked Bar Plot (Relative Frequencies)

We can adjust the stacked bar plot to make the heights the same, so that you can compare conditional distributions. For a **stacked bar plot based on proportions** (also called a **proportional bar plot**),

- The **relative heights** show **conditional distributions** (relative frequencies within subsets).
- The **widths** of the bars have no meaning.

The code below computes the conditional distributions manually first (fractions of outcomes within the two smoking groups). Then these calculations are plotted directly.

```{r}
require(ggplot2)
Whickham %>%
    count(outcome, smoker) %>%
    group_by(smoker) %>%
    mutate(relfreq = n / sum(n)) %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = smoker, y = relfreq, fill = outcome)) + 
    geom_bar(stat = 'identity') + 
    xlab('Smoker Status') + 
    ylab('Proportion') + 
    scale_fill_manual('20 Year Mortality', values = c("steelblue", "lightblue")) + 
    theme_minimal()
```

Another way to make a proportional bar plot is to use the `position = "fill"`

```{r}
require(ggplot2)
Whickham %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = smoker, fill = outcome)) +
    geom_bar(position = "fill") +
    xlab('Smoker Status') + 
    ylab('Proportion') + 
    scale_fill_manual('20 Year Mortality', values = c("steelblue", "lightblue")) + 
    theme_minimal()
```

### Mosaic Plot

The best (Prof. H's opinion) graphic for two categorical variables is a variation on the stacked bar plot called a **mosaic plot**. The total heights of the bars are the same so we can compare the conditional distributions. For a **mosaic plot**, 

- The **relative height** of the bars shows the **conditional distribution** (relative frequency within subsets).
- The **width** of the bars shows the **marginal distribution** (relative frequency of the X variable, ignoring the other variable).
- Making mosaic plots in R requires another package: `ggmosaic`

```{r}
require(ggmosaic)
Whickham %>%
    ggplot() +
    geom_mosaic(aes(x = product(outcome, smoker), fill = outcome)) +
    xlab('Smoker Status') + 
    ylab('Counts') + 
    scale_fill_manual('20 Year Mortality', values = c("steelblue", "lightblue")) + 
    theme_minimal()
```

```{block, type="reflect"}
What do you notice? What do you wonder?
```

With this type of plot, you can see that there are more non-smokers than smokers. Also, you see that there is a higher mortality rate for non-smokers. 

```{block, type="reflect"}
Does our data suggest that smoking *is associated* with a lower mortality rate?  Does our data suggest that smoking *reduces* mortality? Note the difference in these two questions - the second implies a cause and effect relationship.
```

Let's consider a third variable here, age distribution. We can create the same plot, separately for each age group. 

```{r}
Whickham %>%
    ggplot() +
    geom_mosaic(aes(x = product(outcome, smoker), fill = outcome)) + 
    facet_grid( . ~ ageCat) + 
    xlab('Smoker Status') + 
    ylab('Counts') + 
    scale_fill_manual('20 Year Mortality', values = c("steelblue", "lightblue")) + 
    theme_minimal()
```
```{block, type="reflect"}
What do you notice? What do you wonder?
```

```{block, type="reflect"}
How is it that our conclusions are exactly the opposite if we consider the relationship between smoking and mortality within age subsets? What might be going on?
```

This is called **Simpson's Paradox,** which is a situation in which you come to two different conclusions if you look at results overall versus within subsets (e.g. age groups).

Let's look at the marginal distribution of smoking status within each age group. For groups of people that were 68 years of age or younger, it was about 50-50 in terms of smoker vs. non smoker. But, the oldest age group were primarily nonsmokers. 

Now look at the mortality rates within each age category. The 20-year mortality rate among young people (35 or less) was very low, but mortality increases with increased age. So the oldest age group had the highest mortality rate, due primarily to their age, and also had the highest rate of non-smokers. So when we look at everyone together (not subsetting by age), it looks like smoking is associated with a lower mortality rate, when in fact age was just confounding the relationship between smoking status and mortality. 


## One Quantitative Variable

Next, we use data from one of the largest ongoing health studies in the USA, named NHANES. In particular, we will focus on data from the NHANES between 2009-2012 (Source: CDC). For more info about NHANES: https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/index.htm.

Since sleep is vitally important to daily functioning, let's look at the number of hours of sleep respondents reported. 

### Histogram

One main graphical summary we use for quantitative variables is a histogram. It resembles a bar plot, but there are a few key differences:

- The x-axis is a number line that is divided into intervals called **bins**. Bins technically do not all have to be of equal width but almost always are. When making histograms in R, R chooses a default bin width, but you have options to change the number and/or width of the bins/intervals.
- The **height** of the bars shows either the **frequency within intervals** (counts of cases that fall into that bin/interval) or the **density** (fraction of cases that fall into that bin/interval).
- Gaps between bars are meaningful. They indicate absence of values within an interval.

```{r}
data(NHANES)
NHANES %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = SleepHrsNight)) +
    geom_histogram(fill = "steelblue") + 
    xlab('Hours of Sleep (hours)') + 
    ylab('Counts') + 
    theme_minimal() 
```

Note the warning message above: "Removed __ rows containing non-finite values (stat_bin)." Sometimes there is missing information for a variable for some cases in the dataset. We cannot plot these because we don't know their values! This warning message is just a friendly reminder from R to let you know what it is doing.

Also note the message that R gives about bin width to remind us that we can choose this if we wish. If we want to specify the width of the intervals or bins, we can specify `binwidth = DESIRED_BIN_WIDTH` within `geom_histogram`.

```{r}
NHANES %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = SleepHrsNight)) +
    geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, fill = "steelblue") + 
    xlab('Hours of Sleep (hours)') + 
    ylab('Counts') + 
    theme_minimal() 
```

Lastly, notice that the y-axis in the previous two histograms has been the counts (or frequency) within each sleep hour interval. We can adjust this to **density**, which is relative frequency adjusted for the width of interval so that the sum of the areas of the bars (height x width) equals 1. 

```{r}
NHANES %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = SleepHrsNight)) +
    geom_histogram(aes(y = ..density..), binwidth = 1, fill = "steelblue") + 
    geom_density(alpha = 0.2, fill = "steelblue", adjust = 3) + 
    xlab('Hours of Sleep (hours)') + 
    ylab('Density') + 
    theme_minimal() 
```

The smooth curved line on this plot is called a **density plot**. It is essentially a smoother version of the histogram. Both the area under a density plot and the total area of all the rectangles in a density histogram equal 1.

When describing a distribution, we focus on three aspects of the histogram:

- **Shape:** Is it **symmetric** (can you fold it in half and the sides match up)? or is it **skewed to the right or left**? (A distribution is **left-skewed** if there is a long left tail and **right-skewed** if it has a long right tail.) How many **modes** ("peaks"/"bumps" in the distribution) do you see?
- **Center:** Where is a typical value located?
- **Spread** (or variation): How spread out are the values? Concentrated around one or more values or spread out?
- **Unusual features:** Are there **outliers** (points far from the rest)? Are there gaps? Why?


Here is another data set for comparison. Here are the annual salaries for the highest paid CEOs in 2016 (Source: NYTimes). To get the data, we are scraping the data from a NYTimes website. For fun, you can look at the code below. 

```{r}
nyturl <- 'https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/05/26/business/highest-paid-ceos.html?mcubz=0'
dat <- read_html(nyturl)
ceo <- dat %>% 
    html_nodes(".nytg-compensation , .nytg-year") %>% 
    html_text() %>% 
    str_replace('\\$|-','') #webscraping data 
ceo <- data.frame(matrix(ceo,ncol = 2,byrow = TRUE))
names(ceo) <- c('year','salary')
ceo$salary <- as.numeric(ceo$salary) 
ceo <- ceo %>% 
    filter(year == '2016')
```

Let's create a density histogram of the annual salaries for the highest paid CEO's in the U.S. in 2016.

```{r}
ceo %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = salary)) +
    geom_histogram(aes(y = ..density..), binwidth = 15, fill = "steelblue") + 
    geom_density(alpha = 0.2, fill = "steelblue") + 
    xlab('Salary ($ Millions)') + 
    ylab('Counts') + 
    theme_minimal() 
```

We note that some of the highest salaries were close to 200 million U.S. dollars (in 2016), but the majority of the salaries in this sample are closer to 50 million U.D. dollars.

```{block, type="reflect"}
Is this distribution of salaries left-skewed or right-skewed? In what populations do you think salaries might be left-skewed? Right-skewed?
```

### Center

There are some choices for numerically summarizing the center of a distribution:

- **Mean**: The sum of the values divided by the number of values (sample size), $\bar{y} = \frac{\sum^n_{i=1}y_i}{n}$
    + Sensitive to outliers, but it efficiently uses all the data
- **Median**: The "middle" value. The number for which half of the values are below and half are above.
    + Insensitive to outliers, but it doesn't use all the actual values
- **Trimmed means**:  Drop the lowest and highest k% and take the mean of the rest.
    + A good compromise, but not widely used.
    
```{block, type="math"}    
The Greek capital letter sigma, $\sum$, is used in mathematics to denote a sum. We let $y_i$ represent the value of the $i$th person for a variable called $y$. So $\sum^n_{i=1}y_i$ is the sum of all the $n$ values of a variable $y$, all the way from the 1st person to the $n$th person.
```

We can calculate all of these in R.

- **Hours of sleep per night from the NHANES dataset**

```{r}
summary(NHANES$SleepHrsNight) # The $ extracts a certain column of the data set
mean(NHANES$SleepHrsNight, na.rm = TRUE) # na.rm = TRUE removes missing values
median(NHANES$SleepHrsNight, na.rm = TRUE)
mean(NHANES$SleepHrsNight, trim = 0.05, na.rm = TRUE) # Trimmed mean: trim 5% from both tails before taking mean
```

- **CEO salary information from NYT**

```{r}
summary(ceo$salary) # Note the differences between mean and median
mean(ceo$salary) # Arthimetic average
median(ceo$salary) # Middle number
mean(ceo$salary,trim = 0.05)  # Trimmed mean falls in between
```

Note that the mean, median, and trimmed mean are all fairly close for the sleep hours distribution, which looks fairly symmetric.

Note also that the mean, median, and trimmed mean are somewhat different for the salary distribution, which looks right skewed. Often with right skewed distributions, the mean tends to be higher than the median because particularly large values are being summed in the calculation. The median and trimmed mean are not as sensitive to these outliers because of the sorting that is involved in their calculation.

### Boxplot

An alternative graphical summary is a boxplot, which is a simplification of the histogram. The plot consists of 

- A Box: the bottom of the box is at the 25th percentile ($Q1$) and top of the box is at the 75th percentile ($Q3$)
- Line in Box: the line in the middle of the box is at the 50th percentile, the median
- Tails/Whiskers: The lines extend out from the box to most extreme observed values within $1.5 \times (Q3-Q1)$ from $Q1$ (bottom) or $Q3$ (top)
- Points: If any points are beyond $1.5 \times (Q3-Q1)$ from the box edges, they are considered outliers and are plotted separately

```{block, type="math"}    
A percentile is a measure indicating the value below which a given percentage of observations in a group of observations fall. So the 25th percentile is the value at which 25% of the values are below. The 95th percentile is the point at which 95% of the observations are below.
```

Here is a boxplot of the sleep amount from NHANES.

```{r}
NHANES %>%
    ggplot(aes(y = SleepHrsNight)) +
    geom_boxplot() + 
    ylab('Hours of Sleep (hours)') + 
    theme_minimal() 
```

Compare that to the boxplot of the CEO salaries. 

```{r echo=TRUE}
ceo %>%
    ggplot(aes(y = salary)) +
    geom_boxplot() + 
    ylab('Salary ($M)') + 
    theme_minimal() 
```

Note: In these 2 plots above, the x-axis has number labels, but they don't mean anything.

Let's put the boxplots next to the histograms so we can better compare the two types of visualizations. Also, let's add the mean (red dashed), median (blue dotted), and 5% trimmed mean (purple dash-dot) as annotations.

```{r echo=FALSE}
layout(matrix(c(1,2),2,1),heights = c(10,5))
par(mar = c(0,5,4,2))
hist(NHANES$SleepHrsNight, col="lightblue",main="",ylab="# of people",xlab='Hours of Sleep (hrs)',xaxt='n')
abline(v = mean(NHANES$SleepHrsNight,na.rm=TRUE),col='red',lty=2) #na.rm = TRUE removes missing values
abline(v = median(NHANES$SleepHrsNight,na.rm=TRUE), col = 'blue',lty=3)
abline(v = mean(NHANES$SleepHrsNight,trim = 0.05,na.rm=TRUE), col='purple',lty=4)
par(mar = c(5,5,0,2),bty='n')
boxplot(NHANES$SleepHrsNight,horizontal = TRUE,xlab='Hours of Sleep at Night')
abline(v = mean(NHANES$SleepHrsNight,na.rm=TRUE),col='red',lty=2)
abline(v = median(NHANES$SleepHrsNight,na.rm=TRUE), col = 'blue',lty=3)
abline(v = mean(NHANES$SleepHrsNight,trim = 0.05,na.rm=TRUE), col='purple',lty=4)
```

For the hours of sleep, the mean, median, and 5% trimmed mean are all pretty much the same. Note also that the distribution looks pretty symmetric based on the histogram.

```{r echo=FALSE}
layout(matrix(c(1,2),2,1),heights = c(10,5))
par(mar = c(0,5,4,2))
hist(ceo$salary, col="lightgreen",main="",ylab="# of people",xaxt='n',xlim=c(0,200))
abline(v = mean(ceo$salary, na.rm = TRUE),col='red',lty=2) #na.rm = TRUE removes missing values
abline(v = median(ceo$salary, na.rm = TRUE), col = 'blue',lty=3)
abline(v = mean(ceo$salary, trim = 0.05, na.rm = TRUE), col='purple',lty=4)
par(mar = c(5,5,0,2),bty='n')
boxplot(ceo$salary,horizontal = TRUE,xlab='Salary ($N)',ylim=c(0,200))
abline(v = mean(ceo$salary, na.rm = TRUE),col='red',lty=2)
abline(v = median(ceo$salary, na.rm = TRUE), col = 'blue',lty=3)
abline(v = mean(ceo$salary, trim = 0.05, na.rm = TRUE), col='purple',lty=4)
```

For CEO salaries, the mean and 5% trimmed mean are a bit higher than the median. Note also the mean is always pulled toward the long tail. 

```{block, type="reflect"}    
What would the boxplot look like if all of the values were exactly the same? Sometimes when making multiple boxplots for each of multiple groups, a group may only have one value or a small number of values that all happen to be identical. What will this look like?
```

### Spread

There are some choices for numerically summarizing the spread of a distribution:

- **Range**: the maximum value - the minimum value
    + Sensitive to the outliers since it's the difference of the extremes
    + Units (e.g. inches, pounds) are the same as the actual data
- **IQR**: the interquartile range : $Q3 - Q1$ (75th percentile - 25th percentile).
    + Length of the box in a boxplot
    + Spread of middle 50% of data
    + Like the median. Less sensitive because it doesn't use all of the data
    + Units are the same as the actual data
- **Standard deviation** (SD): Root mean squared deviations from mean, $s_y = \sqrt{\frac{\sum^n_{i=1}(y_i-\bar{y})^2}{n-1}}$
    + Roughly the average size of deviation from the mean ($n-1$ instead of $n$)
    + Uses all the data but very sensitive to outliers and skewed data (large values are first squared).
    + Units are the same as the actual data
- **Variance**: Square of the standard deviation
    + Units are the squared version of the actual data's units (e.g. squared inches, pounds)
    + Standard deviation is preferred for interpretability of units
    + Variance will come up when we discuss models in the next chapter

We can calculate all of these in R.

- **Hours of sleep per night from the NHANES dataset**

```{r tidy=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
diff(range(NHANES$SleepHrsNight,na.rm = TRUE)) # range gives max and min; take difference
IQR(NHANES$SleepHrsNight,na.rm = TRUE) # Q3-Q1
sd(NHANES$SleepHrsNight,na.rm=TRUE) # standard deviation
var(NHANES$SleepHrsNight,na.rm=TRUE) # variance
```

- **CEO salary information from NYT**

```{r tidy=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
diff(range(ceo$salary))
IQR(ceo$salary)
sd(ceo$salary)
var(ceo$salary)
```

### Some data accounting {#intro-zscore}

We've looked at different measures of the spread of a distribution. Do some measures of spread encompass a lot of the data? Just a little? Can we be more precise about how much of the data is encompassed by intervals created from different spread measures?

```{r tidy=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
x = rnorm(1500)
boxplot(x,horizontal = TRUE,xlab='Generated Data')
abline(v = range(x), col='blue',lty=3) 
abline(v = quantile(x,c(.25,.75)),col='purple',lty=1)
abline(v = c(mean(x) - sd(x), mean(x) + sd(x)),col='green',lty=2)
```

```{block, type="reflect"}  
What percentage of the data is between the blue dotted lines (length of interval is range)?

What percentage of the data is between the purple solid lines (length of interval is IQR)?

What percentage of the data is between the green dashed lines (length of interval is 2*SD)?
```

The code below computes the fraction of data points that fall between the lower bound of 1 SD below the mean and the upper bound of 1 SD above the mean. 

```{r}
sum(x > mean(x) - sd(x) & x < mean(x) + sd(x))/length(x)
```

So with this generated data, about 68% of the data values fall within 1 SD of the mean.

### Z-scores

How do you decide when an outlier is really unusual (think: athletic victory being very impressive or a data point that may be an error)?

If the observation is far from the rest of the measurements in the data, we tend to say that the value is unusual. We want to quantify this idea of "unusual".

To do this, we often calculate a **z-score**, a standardized data value which we will denote with $z$.

- Calculate how far the observation was below (or above) the mean of the sample. 
- Then divide the difference by the standard deviation (measure of spread).

\[ z = \frac{y - \bar{y}}{s_y} \]

The z-score just tells you how many standard deviations the observation is above or below the mean. 

```{block, type='reflect'}
Say that you got a z-score of 1 on an exam with mean = 80 and SD = 5. That means that you got an 85 on the exam because your exam is one SD above the mean ($mean + z \times SD = 80 + 1 \times 5$).

If you got a z = -2 on an exam with mean = 80 and SD = 5, that means you got a 70 on the exam because your exam is two SD below the mean  ($mean + z \times SD = 80 + -2 \times 5$).
```

In general, it is quite common to have z-scores between -3 and 3, but fairly unusual to have them greater than 3 or less than -3. 

Often, if you have a **unimodal, symmetric distribution**, z-score values will be 

- between -1 and 1 about 68% of the time, 
- between -2 and 2 about 95% of the time, and 
- between -3 and 3 about 99.7% of the time. 

This will not be true always, but it will be true for a particularly special distribution that we will see later when we cover models. (This distribution is called the **normal distribution** or **Gaussian distribution**.)

```{block, type='math'}
(Optional) Chebyshev's inequality gives bounds for the percentages no matter the shape of the distribution. It states that for any real number $k$ > 0, the chance of getting a z-score greater in magnitude (ignoring the negative sign) than $k$ is less than or equal to $1/k^2$,

$$P\left(|Z| \geq k\right) \leq \frac{1}{k^2}$$
where $Z = \frac{|X - \mu|}{\sigma}$ is a z-score, $\mu$ is the mean, and $\sigma$ is the standard deviation. 

If we plug in values for $k$, we see that the chance of getting a z-score 

- at least 3 in magnitude (> 3 or < -3) is less than $(1/3^2) = 0.11 = 11\%$.
- at least 4 in magnitude (> 4 or < -4) is less than $(1/4^2) = 0.06 = 6\%$.
- at least 5 in magnitude (> 5 or < -5) is less than $(1/5^2) = 0.04 = 4\%$.

This is true for any shaped distribution (skewed, bimodal, etc.).
```


In summary, for a quantitative variable,

- Use a histogram to display the distribution of one variable and describe the shape and any unusual features.
- For "well-behaved" distributions (symmetric, unimodal, no outliers), use the mean and standard deviation to describe the center and spread. Then z-scores will roughly follow the 68-95-99.7 rule stated above. 
- For others, use the IQR and median. You can report both mean and median, but it's usually a good idea to state why.



## One Quantitative Variable and One Categorical Variable

Let's return to the NHANES data. We noticed variation in the amount people sleep. Why do some people sleep more than others? Are there any other characteristics that may be able to *explain that variation*?

Let's look at the distribution of hours of sleep at night within subsets of the NHANES data. 

### Multiple Histograms


**Does the recorded binary gender explain the variability in the hours of sleep?**

```{block, type='reflect'}
What are the ethical implications of collecting binary gender if individuals don't fit neatly into the categories?
```

```{r}
NHANES %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = SleepHrsNight)) +
    geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, fill = "steelblue") + 
    xlab('Hours of Sleep (hours)') + 
    facet_grid(~ Gender) + 
    theme_minimal()
```

Do you notice any differences in sleep hour distributions between males and females?

**Does the number of children a mother has explain the variability in the hours of sleep?** 

```{block, type='reflect'}
Who have we excluded from our analysis by asking this question?
```

```{r fig.width=10}
NHANES %>%
    filter(!is.na(nBabies)) %>% 
    ggplot(aes(x = SleepHrsNight)) +
    geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, fill = "steelblue") + 
    xlab('Hours of Sleep (hours)') + 
    facet_wrap(~ factor(nBabies), ncol = 4) + 
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1)) +
    theme_minimal()
```

The 0 to 12 labels at the top of each of these panels correspond to the number of babies a mother had. Do you notice any differences in sleep hour distributions between these groups?

**Does the number of days someone has felt depressed explain the variability in the hours of sleep?**

```{r}
NHANES %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = SleepHrsNight)) +
    geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, fill = "steelblue") + 
    xlab('Hours of Sleep (hours)') + 
    facet_grid(~ Depressed) + 
    theme_minimal() 
```

What's the rightmost "NA" category? Some individuals in this study did not answer questions about days that they might have felt depressed, but they did report their hours of sleep per night.

```{block, type='reflect'}
What selection biases or information biases might be at play here?
```

### Multiple Boxplots

Let's visualize the same information but with boxplots instead of histograms and see if we can glean any other information.

```{r}
NHANES %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = Gender, y = SleepHrsNight)) +
    geom_boxplot() + 
    ylab('Hours of Sleep (hours)') + 
    xlab('Binary Gender') + 
    theme_minimal() 
```


```{r}
NHANES %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = factor(nBabies), y = SleepHrsNight)) +
    geom_boxplot() + 
    ylab('Hours of Sleep (hours)') + 
    xlab('Number of Babies') + 
    theme_minimal() 
```


```{r}
NHANES %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = factor(Depressed), y = SleepHrsNight)) +
    geom_boxplot() + 
    ylab('Hours of Sleep (hours)') + 
    xlab('Days Depressed') + 
    theme_minimal() 
```

```{block type='reflect'}
What do you notice? What do you wonder?
```

#### Is this a Real Difference?

If we notice differences in the center of these distributions, is it a REAL difference? That is, is there a difference in the general U.S. population? Remember, we only have a random *sample* of the population. *NHANES is supposed to be a representative sample of the U.S. population collected using a probability sampling procedure.*

What if there were no REAL difference? Then the Depressed group labels wouldn't be related to the hours of sleep.

**Investigation Plan:**

1. Take all of the observed data on sleep and randomly shuffle into new groups (of the same size as before). This breaks any associations between Depressed group labels and hours of sleep.
2. Calculate the difference in mean hours of sleep between the groups. Record it.
3. Repeat 1 and 2 many times (say 1000 times).
4. Look at the differences based on random shuffles & compare to the observed difference.

```{r echo=TRUE}
NHANES <- NHANES %>%
  mutate(DepressedMost = (Depressed == 'Most')) #TRUE or FALSE (converted to a 2 category variable)

obsdiff <- data.frame(d = diff(mean(SleepHrsNight ~ DepressedMost, data = NHANES, na.rm = TRUE)))

sim <- do(1000)*diff(mean(SleepHrsNight ~ shuffle(DepressedMost), data = NHANES, na.rm = TRUE)) #Randomly shuffle the DepressedMost labels (assuming no real difference in sleep, depressed feelings shouldn't impact sleep)
```

Below, we have a histogram of 1000 values calculated by randomly shuffling individuals in the sample into two groups (assuming no relationship between depression and sleep) and then finding the difference in the mean amount of sleep. The red vertical line showed the observed difference in mean amount of sleep in the data.

```{r}
sim %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = TRUE.)) + 
  geom_histogram(fill = 'steelblue') +
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = d), obsdiff, color = 'red') + 
  xlab('Difference in Mean Hours of Sleep') + 
  ylab('Counts') + 
  theme_minimal() 
```

```{block, type='reflect'}
The observed difference in mean hours of sleep (red line) is quite far from the distribution of differences that results when we break the association between depression status and sleep hours (through randomized shuffling of group labels). What do you think this indicates? What evidence for or against a real population difference might this provide?
```

## Two Quantitative Variables

To discuss two quantitative variables, we will switch to new data set and consider a thought experiment. 

Imagine that you are an entrepreneur selling dress shirts. Clothing sizing can be quite variable across brands, so let's use this dataset to try to come up with our own data-driven sizes. Two of the key measurements that we will use are the neck size in centimeters and chest size in centimeters. There are others in the data set, but let's focus on these for the moment.

### Scatterplot

When you have two quantitative variables, a **scatterplot** is the main appropriate graphical display of the relationship.

```{r echo=TRUE}
bodyfat <- read.delim("http://sites.williams.edu/rdeveaux/files/2014/09/bodyfat.txt")

bodyfat %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = Neck, y = Chest)) +
    geom_point(color = 'steelblue') + 
    xlab('Neck size (cm)') + 
    ylab('Chest size (cm)') +
    theme_minimal()
```

What do you notice about:

1. **Direction** of relationship (positive, negative, neutral)
2. **Form** of relationship (linear, curved, none, other)
3. **Strength** of relationship (compactness around the relationship)
4. **Unusual** features (outliers, differences in variability across $x$)

```{block type='reflect'}
How might you use this information to determine shirt sizes for your new business venture?
```

Suppose instead of *Chest* in inches and *Neck size* in cm, we switched to inches and plotted *Chest* and *Neck size* in inches. 

**Does the strength of the relationship change?**

Look at the plot in inches below. Does this plot look the same as the centimeters plot?

```{r}
bodyfat %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Neck/2.54, y = Chest/2.54)) +
  geom_point(color = 'steelblue') + 
  xlab('Neck size (in)') + 
  ylab('Chest size (in)') +
  theme_minimal()
```


### Correlation Coefficient

Since shifting (adding or subtracting) and scaling (multiplying or dividing) make no difference in the strength of the relationship, let's standardize both variables into z-scores (recall z-scores from Section \@ref(intro-zscore)). Then we replot and add some color:

```{r echo=FALSE}
bodyfat <- bodyfat %>%
    mutate(zNeck = scale(Neck), zChest = scale(Chest), Product = sign(zChest*zNeck))

bodyfat %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = zNeck, y = zChest, color = factor(Product))) +
    geom_point() +
    geom_hline(yintercept = 0) +
    geom_vline(xintercept = 0) +
    xlab('Z-scores of Neck size') + 
    ylab('Z-scores of Chest size') +
    guides(color = guide_legend(title = "Sign of product\nof Z-scores")) +
    theme_minimal() +
    coord_cartesian(xlim = c(-3.5,3.5), ylim = c(-3.5,3.5)) +
    annotate("text", x = c(3, -3, -3, 3), y = c(3.5, 3.5, -3.5, -3.5), label = paste("Quadrant", 1:4))
```

The blue points in the upper right and lower left quadrants are either both positive or both negative in their z-score values. This means that those individuals are above average in both Neck Size and Chest Size (upper right), or they are below average in both Neck Size and Chest Size (lower left). If we multiply the x and y values for the blue points, we will get a positive value. 

The red points in the upper left and lower right quadrants are positive in one and negative in the other. This means that those individuals are either above average in Neck Size but below average in Chest Size or they are below average in Neck Size and above average in Chest Size. If we multiply the x and y values for the red points, we will get a negative value. 

```{block type='reflect'}
If we were to have a weaker positive relationship, how would this plot change?

If we were to have a negative relationship, how would this plot change?
```

We want one number to represent **strength** and **direction** of a linear relationship.

- Points in Quadrants 1 and 3 (blue) have the Z-scores of the **same sign**.
- Points in Quadrants 2 and 4 (red) have Z-scores of the **opposite sign**.

**What if we took the product of the $z$-scores for $x$ and $y$ variables?**

Situation 1: An individual far above the means in both the $x$ and $y$ variables or far below the means in both the $x$ and $y$ variables will have a very large, positive product of z-scores.

Situation 2: An individual far above the mean in $x$ and far below the mean in $y$ will have a very large, negative product of z-scores. (The same goes for low $x$ and high $y$.)

The almost *average* of products of the $z$-scores is the **correlation coefficient**,

$$ r_{x,y} = \frac{\sum z_x z_y}{n-1} $$

$r_{x,y}$ is the correlation coefficient between variables $x$ and $y$.

Some observations:

- If most of our data points follow Situation 1, the correlation coefficient is an average of mostly large positive values. Thus the correlation coefficient will be high and positive.
- If most of our data points follow Situation 2, the correlation coefficient is an average of mostly large negative values. Thus the correlation coefficient will be high and negative.
- If about an equal number of data points follow Situation 1 and Situation 2, we will be averaging a balance of positive and negative numbers, which will be close to zero. Thus the correlation coefficient will be close to zero.

**Which points contribute the most to this average?**

Let's look at the correlation for the entire sample first. Then let's calculate the correlation for individuals around the mean Neck size.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
## The scale() function adds attributes to the columns zNeck, zChest, and Product
## Makes it so that dplyr::filter doesn't work
## Reread the data
bodyfat <- read.delim("http://sites.williams.edu/rdeveaux/files/2014/09/bodyfat.txt")
```

```{r, echo=TRUE}
cor(bodyfat$Neck, bodyfat$Chest) # All data points used in calculation

subset_bodyfat <- bodyfat %>%
    filter(Neck > 35 & Neck < 40) # Keep individuals with Neck size between 35cm and 40cm

cor(subset_bodyfat$Neck, subset_bodyfat$Chest) # Only middle subset of data points used in calculation
```

### Properties

* $-1 \leq r \leq 1$

* Sign of $r$ goes with the direction of the relationship.

* $r_{x,y} = r_{y,x}$, it doesn't matter which is $x$ and which is $y$.

* $r_{ax+b, cy+d} = r_{x,y}$, linear change of scale doesn't affect $r$. Why?

* $r$ measures strength of *linear* relationship (not a curved relationship)

* One outlier can completely change $r$.

Let's look at a few scatterplot examples and the corresponding correlation.

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.width=10}

    barplot(matrix(c(sum_neg, sum_pos)), col = c("#F8766D", "#00BFC4"), main = "Sum (magnitude) of positive\nand negative Z-score products")
}

```


### Is correlation always the right way to judge strength?

The plot below shows the relationship between brownie quality and oven temperature at which the brownie is baked.

The correlation is near 0, but it doesn't mean that there's no relationship. We can clearly see a quadratic relationship, but there's just no **linear** relationship.

![](Photos/Brownies.png)

## Three or more variables

In complex data sets that measure many variables, it is necessary to get a fuller understanding of the relationships in the data than we can see with plots that look at only one or two variables.

The following visual features can help us turn bivariate plots into multivariate plots:

- Color of points and lines
- Shape of points
- Size of points
- Panels (facets)

Let's look at another data set, the 1985 Current Population Survey. This is a smaller scale survey administered by the United States government between the decennial census.

### A bivariate plot

Our primary interest is the `wage` variable which gives the hourly wage for each individual in the data set in US dollars. What is the relationship between years of education and hourly wage?

```{r}
data(CPS85) # Load the data

CPS85 %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = educ, y = wage)) +
    geom_point() +
    xlab("Years of education") +
    ylab("Hourly wage (US dollars)") +
    theme_minimal()
```

We can see that years of education and hourly wage are positively correlated but what about the impact of other variables?

### Enriching with color

We can enrich this bivariate plot by showing additional information via color.

```{r}
data(CPS85) ## Load the data

CPS85 %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = educ, y = wage, color = age)) +
    geom_point() +
    xlab("Years of education") +
    ylab("Hourly wage (US dollars)") +
    theme_minimal()
```

Adding color for a quantitative variable, age, does not reveal any obvious patterns; that is, we don't see obvious clustering by color. Perhaps this is because there are too many colors (remember Visualization Principle #6: Use Color Appropriately). Are any patterns revealed if we use 4 age categories instead?

```{r}
CPS85 %>%
    mutate(age_cat = cut(age, 4)) %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = educ, y = wage, color = age_cat)) +
    geom_point() +
    xlab("Years of education") +
    ylab("Hourly wage (US dollars)") +
    guides(color = guide_legend(title = "Age category")) + # Legend title
    theme_minimal()
```

With 4 age categories, no age patterns are evident, but this does help us see that the least educated people in this data set are mostly in the youngest and oldest age categories.

### Enriching with shape

We can also encode information via point shape. Here we let shape encode marital status.

```{r}
CPS85 %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = educ, y = wage, shape = married)) +
    geom_point() +
    xlab("Years of education") +
    ylab("Hourly wage (US dollars)") +
    guides(shape = guide_legend(title = "Marital status")) + # Legend title
    theme_minimal()
```

Often encoding information with color is preferable to encoding it with shapes because differences in shapes are not as easily discernible. Remember that statistical visualizations are meant to help you better understand your data. If you are having trouble easily picking out patterns when using a certain visual feature (e.g. shape, color), try another one to see if the clarity of the plot increases for you.

### Enriching with size

The size of a point is useful for conveying the magnitude of a quantitative variable. For example, we may wish to see non-categorized age information with point size.

```{r}
CPS85 %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = educ, y = wage, size = age)) +
    geom_point() +
    xlab("Years of education") +
    ylab("Hourly wage (US dollars)") +
    guides(size = guide_legend(title = "Age")) + # Legend title
    theme_minimal()
```

### Enriching with panels

Panels (or facets) are a great way to see how relationships differ between levels of a single categorical variable or between combinations of two categorical variables.

Let's look at the relationship between hourly wage and years of education across job sectors. The following creates a row of plots of this relationship over job sectors.

```{r}
CPS85 %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = educ, y = wage)) +
    geom_point() +
    xlab("Years of education") +
    ylab("Hourly wage (US dollars)") +
    facet_grid(. ~ sector) +
    theme_minimal()
```

With a small change in notation (`sector ~ .` versus `. ~ sector`), we can create a column of plots.

```{r}
CPS85 %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = educ, y = wage)) +
    geom_point() +
    xlab("Years of education") +
    ylab("Hourly wage (US dollars)") +
    facet_grid(sector ~ .) +
    theme_minimal()
```

We can also create panels according to two categorical variables. How do the relationships additionally differ by union status?

```{r}
CPS85 %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = educ, y = wage)) +
    geom_point() +
    xlab("Years of education") +
    ylab("Hourly wage (US dollars)") +
    facet_grid(sector ~ union) +
    theme_minimal()
```

### Putting everything together

The combination of these different visual features can result in powerful visual understanding. Let's combine paneling with color information to explore if there are marital status patterns in these union-job sector subgroups.

```{r}
CPS85 %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = educ, y = wage, color = married)) +
    geom_point() +
    xlab("Years of education") +
    ylab("Hourly wage (US dollars)") +
    facet_grid(sector ~ union) + 
    guides(color = guide_legend(title = "Marital status")) + # Legend title
    theme_minimal()
```

Creating effective multivariate visualizations takes a lot of trial and error. Some visual elements will better highlight patterns than others, and often times, you'll have to try several iterations before you feel that you are learning something insightful from the graphic. Be tenacious, and keep in mind the good visualization principles outlined at the beginning of this chapter!

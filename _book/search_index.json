There is a saying that “a picture is worth a 1000 words.” In making visualizations, our goal is to quickly and easily get a better understanding of the variability and relationships that exist in the data. Here we will cover the standard appropriate graphics for univariate variation and bivariate relationships. The choice of the graphic depends on the type(s) of variable(s): quantitative or categorical. So the first step is to think about the variables you are interested in visualizing and determining whether they are quantitative or categorical. For each type of variable, we will use a real data set to illustrate the visualizations. First, we consider survey data of the electoral registrar in Whickham in the UK (Source: Appleton et al 1996). Survey was conducted in 1972-1974 to study heart disease and thyroid disease (baseline characteristics: age and smoking status) A follow-up on those in the survey was conducted twenty years later (followup characteristics: mortality after 20 years) 3.1 One Categorical Variable Let’s first consider the age distribution. Age, depending on how it is measured, could act as a quantitative variable or categorical variable. In this case, age is a quantitative variable because it is recorded to the nearest year. But, for illustrative purposes, I’m going to create a categorical variable by separating age into intervals. What do I lose when I convert a quantitative variable to a categorical variable? What do I gain? 3.1.1 Bar Plot The height of the bars is the only part that encodes the data (width is meaningless). The height can either represent the frequency (count of cases) or the relative frequency (proportion of cases). data(Whickham) #load data set from package Whickham &lt;- Whickham %&gt;% mutate(ageCat = cut(age, 4)) #Create a new categorical variable with 4 categories based on age (equal length of age intervals) Whickham %&gt;% count(ageCat) %&gt;% mutate(relfreq = n / sum(n)) ## # A tibble: 4 x 3 ## ageCat n relfreq ## &lt;fct&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 (17.9,34.5] 408 0.311 ## 2 (34.5,51] 367 0.279 ## 3 (51,67.5] 347 0.264 ## 4 (67.5,84.1] 192 0.146 Whickham %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = ageCat)) + geom_bar(fill=&quot;steelblue&quot;) + xlab(&#39;Age Categories in Years&#39;) + ylab(&#39;Counts&#39;) + theme_minimal() What do you notice? What do you wonder? 3.1.2 Pie Chart Pie charts are only useful if you have 2 to 3 possible categories and you want to show relative group sizes. This is the best use for a pie chart: I’m purposefully not showing you how to make a pie chart because a bar chart is a better choice. Here is a good summary of why I hate pie charts: http://www.businessinsider.com/pie-charts-are-the-worst-2013-6 (make sure to read if you like pie charts!) 3.2 Two Categorical Variables Now, let’s consider two other variables in the same data set. What is the relationship between 20-year mortality outcome and smoking status at the beginning of the study. 3.2.1 Side by Side Bar Plot The height of the bars shows the frequency of the categories within subsets. Whickham %&gt;% count(outcome, smoker) %&gt;% mutate(relfreq = n/sum(n)) #Overall Relative Frequency ## # A tibble: 4 x 4 ## outcome smoker n relfreq ## &lt;fct&gt; &lt;fct&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 Alive No 502 0.382 ## 2 Alive Yes 443 0.337 ## 3 Dead No 230 0.175 ## 4 Dead Yes 139 0.106 Whickham %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = smoker, fill = outcome)) + geom_bar(position = position_dodge()) + xlab(&quot;Smoker Status&quot;) + ylab(&quot;Counts&quot;) + scale_fill_manual(&quot;20 Year Mortality&quot;, values = c(&quot;steelblue&quot;, &quot;lightblue&quot;)) + theme_minimal() What do you notice? What do you wonder? 3.2.2 Stacked Bar Plot The height of the entire bar shows the marginal distribution (frequency of the X variable, ignoring the other variable). The relative heights show conditional distributions (frequencies within subsets), but it is hard to compare distributions between bars because the overall heights differ. Distribution: the way something is spread out (aka the way in which values vary). Whickham %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = smoker, fill = outcome)) + geom_bar() + xlab(&quot;Smoker Status&quot;) + ylab(&quot;Counts&quot;) + scale_fill_manual(&quot;20 Year Mortality&quot;, values = c(&quot;steelblue&quot;, &quot;lightblue&quot;)) + theme_minimal() What do you notice? What do you wonder? 3.2.3 Mosaic Plot The relative height of the bars shows the conditional distribution (relative frequency within subsets). The width of the bars shows the marginal distribution (relative frequency of the X variable, ignoring the other variable). Whickham %&gt;% ggplot() + geom_mosaic(aes(x = product(outcome, smoker), fill = outcome)) + xlab(&#39;Smoker Status&#39;) + ylab(&#39;Counts&#39;) + scale_fill_manual(&#39;20 Year Mortality&#39;,values=c(&quot;steelblue&quot;, &quot;lightblue&quot;)) + theme_minimal() What do you notice? What do you wonder? Gut Check: Does our data suggest that smoking is associated with a lower mortality rate? Does our data suggest that smoking reduces mortality? (Note the difference in these two questions - the second implies cause and effect) Whickham %&gt;% ggplot() + geom_mosaic(aes(x = product(outcome, smoker), fill = outcome)) + facet_grid( . ~ ageCat) + xlab(&#39;Smoker Status&#39;) + ylab(&#39;Counts&#39;) + scale_fill_manual(&#39;20 Year Mortality&#39;,values=c(&quot;steelblue&quot;, &quot;lightblue&quot;)) + theme_minimal() What do you notice? What do you wonder? Gut Check: How is it that our conclusions are exactly the opposite if we consider the relationship between smoking and mortality within age subsets? This is called Simpson’s Paradox, which is a situation in which you come to two different conclusions if you look at results overall versus within subsets (e.g. age groups). Let’s look at the marginal distribution of smoking status within each age group. For groups of people that were 68 years of age or younger, it was about 50-50 in terms of smoker vs. non smoker. But, the oldest age group were primarily nonsmokers. Now look at the mortality rates within each age category. The 20-year mortality rate among young people (35 or less) was very low but that increases with increased age. So the oldest age group had the highest mortality rate, due primarily to their age, and also had the highest rate of non-smokers. So when we look at everyone together (not subsetting by age), it looks like smoking is associated with a lower mortality rate, when in fact age was just confounding the relationship between smoking status and mortality. 3.3 One Quantitative Variable Next, we will use data from one of the largest ongoing health studies in the USA, named NHANES. In particular, we will focus on data from the NHANES between 2009-2012 (Source: CDC). Since sleep is vitally important to daily functioning, let’s look at the number of hours of sleep respondants reported. 3.3.1 Histogram The height of the bars shows either the frequency within intervals or the density (relative frequency per unit of measure, e.g. proportion of people per hour sleep) The x-axis is a number line and bars do not have to be of equal width (R chooses a default bin width, but you can change how many intervals and how large they are) #For more info about NHANES: https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/index.htm NHANES %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = SleepHrsNight)) + geom_histogram(fill = &quot;steelblue&quot;) + #Gaps are meaningful xlab(&#39;Hours of Sleep (hours)&#39;) + ylab(&#39;Counts&#39;) + theme_minimal() ## Warning: Removed 2245 rows containing non-finite values (stat_bin). NHANES %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = SleepHrsNight)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, fill = &quot;steelblue&quot;) + #Gaps are meaningful xlab(&#39;Hours of Sleep (hours)&#39;) + ylab(&#39;Counts&#39;) + theme_minimal() ## Warning: Removed 2245 rows containing non-finite values (stat_bin). NHANES %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = SleepHrsNight)) + geom_histogram(aes(y = ..density..), binwidth = 1, fill = &quot;steelblue&quot;) + geom_density(alpha = 0.2, fill = &quot;steelblue&quot;, adjust = 3) + xlab(&#39;Hours of Sleep (hours)&#39;) + ylab(&#39;Counts&#39;) + theme_minimal() ## Warning: Removed 2245 rows containing non-finite values (stat_bin). ## Warning: Removed 2245 rows containing non-finite values (stat_density). We focus on three aspects of the histogram/distribution: Shape: Is it symmetric? or is itskewed to the right or left (Distributions are skewed to the long tail - which side has a long tail)? How many modes do you see? Center: Where is a typical value located? Spread (or variation): How spread out are the values? (Concentrated around one or more values or spread out?) Also, we ask: Are there any unusual features such as outliers or gaps? Why? Here is another data set for comparison: CEO salaries for the highest paid CEOs in 2016 (Source: NYTimes). nyturl &lt;- &#39;https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/05/26/business/highest-paid-ceos.html?mcubz=0&#39; dat &lt;- read_html(nyturl) ceo &lt;- dat %&gt;% html_nodes(&quot;.nytg-compensation , .nytg-year&quot;) %&gt;% html_text() %&gt;% str_replace(&#39;\\\\$|-&#39;,&#39;&#39;) #webscraping data ceo &lt;- data.frame(matrix(ceo,ncol = 2,byrow = TRUE)) names(ceo) &lt;- c(&#39;year&#39;,&#39;salary&#39;) ceo$salary &lt;- as.numeric(ceo$salary) ceo &lt;- ceo %&gt;% filter(year == &#39;2016&#39;) #Highest Paid CEO&#39;s in the U.S. in 2016 (Source: NYTimes) ceo %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = salary)) + geom_histogram(aes(y = ..density..), binwidth = 15, fill = &quot;steelblue&quot;) + geom_density(alpha = 0.2, fill = &quot;steelblue&quot;) + xlab(&#39;Salary ($M)&#39;) + ylab(&#39;Counts&#39;) + theme_minimal() For center, we have some choices for numerically summarizing it: Mean: The sum of the values divided by the number of values (sample size), \\(\\bar{y} = \\frac{\\sum^n_{i=1}y_i}{n}\\) Sensitive to outliers, but efficiently uses all the data Median: The “middle” value. The number for which half of the values are below and half are above. Insensitive to outliers, but doesn’t use all the actual values Trimmed means: Drop the lowest and highest k% and take the mean of the rest. A good compromise, but not widely used. summary(NHANES$SleepHrsNight) ## Min. 1st Qu. Median Mean 3rd Qu. Max.

Also, let’s add the mean (red dashed), median (blue dotted), and 5% trimmed mean (purple dash-dot). What would the boxplot look like if all of the values were exactly the same? For spread we have several choices to numerically describe it: Range: the maximum value - the minimum value Sensitive to the outliers since it’s the difference of the extremes IQR: the interquartile range : Q3 - Q1 (75th percentile - 25th percentile). Length of the box in a boxplot Spread of middle 50% of data Like the median. Less sensitive because it doesn’t use all of the data Standard deviation: Root mean squared deviations from mean, \\(s = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sum^n_{i=1}(y_i-\\bar{y})^2}{n-1}}\\) Roughly the average size of deviation from the mean (\\(n-1\\) instead of \\(n\\)) Uses all the data but very sensitive to outliers and skewed data (large values are first squared). diff(range(NHANES$SleepHrsNight, na.rm = TRUE)) #range gives max and min; take difference ## [1] 10 IQR(NHANES$SleepHrsNight, na.rm = TRUE) #Q3-Q1 ## [1] 2 sd(NHANES$SleepHrsNight, na.rm = TRUE) #standard deviation ## [1] 1.346729 diff(range(ceo$salary)) ## [1] 156 IQR(ceo$salary) ## [1] 59.25 sd(ceo$salary) ## [1] 39.05955 x = rnorm(1500) boxplot(x, horizontal = TRUE, xlab = &quot;Generated Data&quot;) abline(v = range(x), col = &quot;blue&quot;, lty = 3) abline(v = quantile(x, c(0.25, 0.75)), col = &quot;purple&quot;, lty = 1) abline(v = c(-sd(x), sd(x)), col = &quot;green&quot;, lty = 2) What percentage of the data is between the blue dotted lines (length of interval is range)? What percentage of the data is between the purple solid lines (length of interval is IQR)? What percentage of the data is between the green dashed lines (length of interval is 2*SD)? sum(x &gt; -sd(x) &amp; x &lt; sd(x))/length(x) ## [1] 0.676 In summary, for a quantitative variable, Use a histogram to display the distribution of one variable and describe the shape and any unusual features. For “well behaved” distributions (symmetric, unimodal, no outliers), use the mean and standard deviation to describe the center and spread. For others, use the IQR and median. You can report both mean and median, but it’s usually a good idea to state why. 3.4 One Quantitive Variable and One Categorical Variable Why do some people sleep more than others? Let’s look at the distribution of hours of sleep at night within subsets of the NHANES data. 3.4.1 Multiple Histograms Does the recorded binary gender explain the variability in the hours of sleep? (Quick ethics consideration: what are the implications of collecting binary gender as a variable even if gender is not considered binary?) NHANES %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = SleepHrsNight)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, fill = &quot;steelblue&quot;) + xlab(&#39;Hours of Sleep (hours)&#39;) + facet_grid(~Gender) + theme_minimal() ## Warning: Removed 2245 rows containing non-finite values (stat_bin). Does the number of child a parents has explain the variability in the hours of sleep? (Quick ethics consideration: who have we excluded from our analysis?) NHANES %&gt;% filter(!is.na(nBabies)) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = SleepHrsNight)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, fill = &quot;steelblue&quot;) + xlab(&#39;Hours of Sleep (hours)&#39;) + facet_grid(~factor(nBabies)) + theme_minimal() ## Warning: Removed 8 rows containing non-finite values (stat_bin). Does the number of days someone has felt depressed explain the variability in the hours of sleep? NHANES %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = SleepHrsNight)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, fill = &quot;steelblue&quot;) + xlab(&#39;Hours of Sleep (hours)&#39;) + facet_grid(~Depressed) + theme_minimal() ## Warning: Removed 2245 rows containing non-finite values (stat_bin). What do you notice? What do you wonder? 3.4.2 Multiple Boxplots Let’s try that again but with boxplots and see if we can glean any more information. NHANES %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = Gender, y = SleepHrsNight)) + geom_boxplot() + ylab(&#39;Hours of Sleep (hours)&#39;) + xlab(&#39;Binary Gender&#39;) + theme_minimal() ## Warning: Removed 2245 rows containing non-finite values (stat_boxplot). NHANES %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = factor(nBabies), y = SleepHrsNight)) + geom_boxplot() + ylab(&#39;Hours of Sleep (hours)&#39;) + xlab(&#39;Number of Babies&#39;) + theme_minimal() ## Warning: Removed 2245 rows containing non-finite values (stat_boxplot). NHANES %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = factor(Depressed), y = SleepHrsNight)) + geom_boxplot() + ylab(&#39;Hours of Sleep (hours)&#39;) + xlab(&#39;Days Depressed&#39;) + theme_minimal() ## Warning: Removed 2245 rows containing non-finite values (stat_boxplot). What do you notice? What do you wonder? 3.4.2.1 Is this a Real Difference? If we notice differences in the center of these distributions, is it a REAL difference? Is there a difference in the general U.S. population? Remember, we just have a random sample of the population NHANES is supposed to be a representative sample of the U.S. population collected using a random sampling procedure. What if there were no REAL difference? Then the Depressed group labels wouldn’t be related to the hours of sleep. Investigation Plan: Take all of the observed data on sleep and randomly shuffle into new groups (of the same size as before). Calculate the difference in mean hours of sleep between the groups. Record it. Repeat 1 and 2 many times (say 1000 times). Look at the differences based on random shuffles &amp; compare to the observed difference. require(mosaic) ## Loading required package: mosaic ## Loading required package: lattice ## Loading required package: ggformula ## Loading required package: ggstance ## ## Attaching package: &#39;ggstance&#39; ## The following objects are masked from &#39;package:ggplot2&#39;: ## ## geom_errorbarh, GeomErrorbarh ## ## New to ggformula?

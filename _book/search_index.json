["goals-for-models.html", "3.1 Goals for models", " 3.1 Goals for models Broadly, a model is a simplified representation of the world. When we build models, we may have different goals. One goal when building models is prediction. Given data on a response or outcome variable \\(y\\) and one or more predictor or explanatory variables \\(x\\), the goal is to find a function, \\(f\\) that will model and predict \\(y\\) from \\(x\\). This \\(x\\) may be a single variable, but is most often a set of variables. We’ll be building up to multivariate modeling over the course of this chapter. What are the qualities of a good function \\(f\\)? We want to find an \\(f(x)\\) such that \\(\\hat{y} = f(x)\\) is a good predictor of \\(y\\). In other words, we want the model prediction \\(\\hat{y}\\) to be close to the observed response. We want \\(y-\\hat{y}\\) to be small. This difference \\(y-\\hat{y}\\) is called a residual. We’ll discuss residuals more later. Can you think of some concrete examples in which we’d want a model to do prediction? Another goal when building models is description. We want a model, \\(f(x)\\), to “explain” the relationship between the \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) variables. Note that an overly complicated model may not be that useful here because it can’t help us understand the relationship. A more complex model may, however, produce better predictions. George Box is often quoted “All models are wrong but some are useful.” Depending on our goal, one model may be more useful than another. Can you think of some concrete examples in which we’d want a model to do explain a phenomenon? To begin, we will consider a simple, but powerful model in which we limit this function \\(f\\) to be a straight line with a y-intercept, \\(b_0\\), and slope, \\(b_1\\). \\[\\hat{y} = f(x) = b_0 + b_1x\\] This is a simple linear regression model. It is the foundation of many statistical models used in modern statistics and is more flexible than you may think. In the past, you may have seen the equation of a line as \\[y = mx + b\\] where \\(m\\) is the slope and \\(b\\) is the y-intercept. We will be using different notation so that it can generalize to multiple linear regression. The y-intercept is the value when \\(x=0\\) and the slope is change in y for each addition value of x (rise/run). "],

For many people, the shirt would be too tight because their chest and/or neck sizes would be larger than average. For many people, the shirt would be too large because they chest and/or neck sizes would be smaller than average. Let’s try something else. Let’s allow ourselves 5 different sizes (XS, S, M, L, XL). Then, we can cut the Neck sizes variable into 5 groups of equal length and estimate the mean Chest sizes within each of these groups. What do these lines tell us for our business venture? What if we wanted to be able to make more sizes? Could we get a pretty good sense of what the chest sizes should be for a given neck size? Could we find one line to describe the relationship between Neck size and Chest size? What does line tell us for our business venture? If the scatterplot between two quantitative variables resembles a straight line, a straight line could roughly describe the mean of y for each value of x. a straight line could describe how much we’d expect y to change based on a 1 unit change in x. a straight line could help us predict the y based on a new value of x.

We can see there is valley where the minimum must be. Let’s visualize this in a slightly different way. We’ll encode the surface height as color (white is lowest). The large values of the sum of squared residuals are dominating this image, so let’s change the color scheme to see more variation in smaller values (white is lowest).

(Optional) Alternative ways to find the minimum sum of squared residuals We could try a numerical optimization algorithm such as steepest descent. We could use multivariable calculus (find partial derivatives, set equal to 0, and solve). To get started on the calculus, solve the following two equations for the two unknowns (\\(b_0\\) and \\(b_1\\)): \\[\\frac{\\partial }{\\partial b_0}\\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - (b_0 + b_1x_i))^2 = 0\\] \\[\\frac{\\partial }{\\partial b_1}\\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - (b_0 + b_1x_i))^2 = 0\\] If you are a math/physics/cs major, you should try this by hand and see if you can get the solutions below. If you find the minimum via calculus, you’ll find that we can write the Least Squares solution in an equation format as functions of summary statistics (!), the estimated slope is \\[ b_1 = r\\frac{s_y}{s_x}\\] and the estimated intercept is \\[ b_0 = \\bar{y} - b_1\\bar{x} \\] where \\(\\bar{x}\\) is the mean of the variable on the x-axis, \\(\\bar{y}\\) is the mean of the variable on the y-axis, \\(s_x\\) is the standard deviation of the variable on the x-axis, \\(s_y\\) is the standard deviation of the variable on the y-axis, and \\(r\\) is the correlation coefficient between the two variables.

So for a given neck size, Calvin Klein makes shirts that are a little bit too small at the chest. For Express, we see that the red boxes are generally on the least squares line, except for the smallest size. This means that Express shirts are generally a good fit at the chest and neck for the 4 largest sizes, but the smallest shirt size is a bit too small at the chest for the neck size. For Brooks Brothers, the red boxes are a bit below the least squares line for the 3 smallest sizes and a little above the line for the largest size. This means that the 3 smallest sizes are a bit too small at the chest for those neck size and that the largest shirt is a bit big at the chest for that neck size.

The “within observed range of \\(x\\)” is very important. We can’t predict values of \\(y\\) for values of \\(x\\) that are very different from what we have in our data. Trying to do so is a big no-no called extrapolation. We’ll discuss this more in a bit. Intercept (\\(b_0\\)) The intercept gives the average value of \\(y\\) when \\(x\\) is zero (think about context) Example: If Neck size = 0, then the person doesn’t exist. In this context, the intercept doesn’t make much sense to interpret. For this reason, sometimes the predictor \\(x\\) is centered. That is, the mean of \\(x\\) for all individuals in the sample is computed, and this mean is subtracted from each person’s \\(x\\) value. In this case, the intercept is interpreted as the average value of \\(y\\) when \\(x\\) is at its (sample) mean value. Slope (\\(b_1\\)) The slope gives the change in average \\(y\\) per 1 unit increase in \\(x\\) (not for individuals and not causal) Example: If we consider all individuals with a neck size 1 cm larger, then we’d expect the average chest size to be by about 2.7cm larger. 3.6.1 Correlation or Association vs. Causation What is causation? What is a causal effect? Are there criteria for defining a cause? These are deep questions that have been debated by scientists of all domains for a long time. We are at a point now where there is some consensus on the definition of a causal effect. The causal effect of a variable \\(x\\) on another variable \\(y\\) is the amount that we expect \\(y\\) to change if we intervene on/manipulate \\(x\\) by changing it by one unit. When can we interpret an estimated slope \\(b_1\\) from a simple linear regression as a causal effect of \\(x\\) on \\(y\\)? Well, in the simple linear regression case, almost never. To interpret the slope causally, there would have to be no confounding variables (no variables that impact both \\(x\\) and \\(y\\).) In no real world situation will this be the case. Then what are we to do? We will get to adjusting/controlling for confounders in the section on multiple linear regression. Multiple linear regression offers us a way to obtain causal effects of variables if we use it carefully. It will be tempting to say: control for everything we can! But we will see that this is not the correct thing to do, as there are very real dangers of over-controlling for variables. For now, let it suffice to say that multiple linear regression is as useful as the corn kerneler below. Immensely useful in the right circumstances - but only those circumstances. Source: Gizmodo "],

If you extrapolate beyond the minimum or maximum of the observed values, then you are assuming that the relationship you observe can be extended into the new prediction range. This is the main issue of forecasting, making predictions in the future. You have to assume that the trend that you observe now will continue in the future and that the current state of affairs will stay the same. For an infamous case of extrapolation, check out this article that appeared in the journal Nature. 3.7.2 Prediction Errors Recall that a residual \\(e_i\\) for data point \\(i\\) is the difference between the actual and predicted values: \\(e_i = y_i - \\hat{y}_i\\). If the residuals were approximately unimodal and symmetric, we expect about 95% of the residuals to be within 2 standard deviations of 0 (the mean residual). (Recall Section 2.12.5.) hist(residuals(lm.gpa), main = &quot;Distribution of residuals in the GPA model&quot;) Below we calculate \\(SSE\\), the sum of squared residuals, and the standard deviation of the residuals, \\(s_e\\). SSE = sum(residuals(lm.gpa)^2) n = length(residuals(lm.gpa)) # Sample size s = sqrt(SSE/(n-2)) # Residual standard error s ## [1] 0.2814443 2*s ## [1] 0.5628886 Using this model (that is, using your high school GPA), we can predict your college GPA within about \\(0.56\\) GPA points. Is this useful? Is a margin of \\(0.56\\) GPA points good enough? Let’s compare this margin of error with the margin of error about the mean (the standard deviation): sd(sat$univ_GPA) ## [1] 0.4471936 2*sd(sat$univ_GPA) ## [1] 0.8943873 Without knowing your high school GPA, we could have just guessed your college GPA as the mean college GPA in the sample, and this guess would be within \\(\\pm 0.89\\) of your actual college GPA. This is a higher margin of error than the approximate \\(0.56\\) if we did use your high school GPA (in the simple linear regression model). We are able to predict your college GPA with a smaller margin of error than if we just guessed your college GPA with the mean. Our model has explained some (but not all) of the variation in college GPA. The standard deviation of college GPA is based on the sum of squared total variation, SSTO (variation around the mean), \\[ SSTO = \\sum{(y_i -\\bar{y})^2} \\] \\(SSTO\\) is the numerator of the standard deviation of \\(y\\) (without knowing anything about \\(x\\)). (SSTO = sum((sat$univ_GPA - mean(sat$univ_GPA))^2)) ## [1] 20.79814 We define \\(SSTO\\) here because it will help to compare \\(SSTO\\) to \\(SSE\\) (sum of squared residuals from the model) to obtain a measure of how well our models are fitting the data - how well they are predicting the outcome. 3.7.3 \\(R^2\\) Let’s study how models reduce unexplained variation. Unexplained variation is given by \\(SSTO\\). It is just the overall variability in the outcome. Think back to interpreting standard deviation and variance as measures of spread. We used these to describe broadly how variable the outcome was. Variation in the outcome that remains after trying to explain the outcome is given by \\(SSE\\), the sum of squared residuals. So to study how models reduce unexplained variation, we will compare residuals from a linear regression model (which uses the predictor \\(x\\)) with the original deviations from the mean (which do not use the predictor \\(x\\)). We started with the sum of the deviations from the mean \\(SSTO = \\sum{(y_i - \\bar{y})^2}\\) before we had info about high school GPA (\\(x\\)). Now, with our knowledge of \\(x\\), we have \\(SSE = \\sum{(y_i - \\hat{y_i})^2}\\) \\(SSE\\) should be smaller than \\(SSTO\\) (!) Two extreme cases: If the error \\(SSE\\) goes to zero, we’d have a “perfect fit”. If \\(SSE = SSTO\\), \\(x\\) has told us nothing about \\(y\\). So we define a measure called R-squared, which is the fraction or percent of the total variation in \\(y\\) “accounted for” by the model in \\(x\\). \\[ R^2 = 1 - \\frac{SSE}{SSTO} = 1 - \\frac{ \\sum{(y_i - \\hat{y_i})^2}}{ \\sum{(y_i - \\bar{y})^2}}\\] In R, lm() will calculate R-Squared for us, but we can also see that it equals the value from the formula above. 1 - SSE/SSTO ## [1] 0.6077187 glance(lm.gpa) #r.squared = R^2, sigma = s_e (ignore the rest) ## # A tibble: 1 x 11 ## r.squared adj.r.squared sigma statistic p.value df logLik AIC BIC ## * &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 0.608 0.604 0.281 160. 1.18e-22 2 -14.9 35.7 43.7 ## # ... with 2 more variables: deviance &lt;dbl&gt;, df.residual &lt;int&gt; Is there a “good” value of \\(R^2\\)?

If the plot does thicken, see solutions below. Problem: Spread is NOT the same throughout You may be able to transform the y-variable using mathematical functions (\\(log(y)\\), \\(y^2\\), etc.) to make the spread more consistent (one approach is to use Box-Cox Transformation – take more statistics classes to learn more) Be careful in interpreting the standard deviation of the residuals. (For example, if you take a log transformation of the outcome, the units of the standard deviation of the residuals will be on the log scale.) Problem: You have extreme outliers Look into the outliers. Determine if they could be due to human error. Think carefully about them, dig deep. Do a sensitivity analysis: Fit a model with and without the outlier and see if your conclusions drastically change (see if those points had leverage to change the model). "],
["multiple-linear-regression.html", "3.9 Multiple Linear Regression", " 3.9 Multiple Linear Regression We can generalize the idea of a simple linear model by including many explanatory variables (X’s). A multiple linear regression model can be written as: \\[\\hat{y}_i = b_0 + b_1x_{i1} + \\cdots + b_kx_{ik}\\] Each coefficient \\(b_j\\) can be interpreted as the increase in the predicted/average y associated with a 1 unit increase in \\(x_j\\), keeping all other variables constant. (*There are some exceptions - we’ll get there.) These X variables can be: Quantitative variables (or transformations of them) Indicator variables for categorical variables (only need \\(k-1\\) indicators for a variable with \\(k\\) categories) Interaction terms (product of two variables, which allows for effect modification) Let’s talk about a new data example: home prices. We want to build a model to predict the price of a home based on its many characteristics. Here we have a data set of homes recently sold in New England with many variables such as the age of the home, the land value, whether or not it has central air conditioning, the number of fireplaces, the sale price, and more… homes &lt;- read.delim(&#39;http://sites.williams.edu/rdeveaux/files/2014/09/Saratoga.txt&#39;) head(homes) ## Price Lot.Size Waterfront Age Land.Value New.Construct Central.Air ## 1 132500 0.09 0 42 50000 0 0 ## 2 181115 0.92 0 0 22300 0 0 ## 3 109000 0.19 0 133 7300 0 0 ## 4 155000 0.41 0 13 18700 0 0 ## 5 86060 0.11 0 0 15000 1 1 ## 6 120000 0.68 0 31 14000 0 0 ## Fuel.Type Heat.Type Sewer.Type Living.Area Pct.College Bedrooms ## 1 3 4 2 906 35 2 ## 2 2 3 2 1953 51 3 ## 3 2 3 3 1944 51 4 ## 4 2 2 2 1944 51 3 ## 5 2 2 3 840 51 2 ## 6 2 2 2 1152 22 4 ## Fireplaces Bathrooms Rooms ## 1 1 1.0 5 ## 2 0 2.5 6 ## 3 1 1.0 8 ## 4 1 1.5 5 ## 5 0 1.0 3 ## 6 1 1.0 8 *The exception to the interpretation comment above is if our variables are strongly correlated. In this case, we cannot keep all other variables constant because if you increase the value of one, then a variable with high correlation will also likely change in value. 3.9.1 Indicator Variables In New England, fireplaces are often used as a way to heat the house. Let’s study the impact of a fireplace has on the sale price of a home. In particular, we only care if the home has 1 or more fireplaces or no fireplaces. So we make a new variable that is TRUE if there are more than 0 fireplaces in a home and FALSE otherwise. homes &lt;- homes %&gt;% mutate(AnyFireplace = Fireplaces &gt; 0) In order to include this information in our linear regression model, we need to turn that categorical variable (AnyFireplace, TRUE or FALSE) into an indicator variable, which has a numeric value of 0 or 1: \\[ 1_{AnyFireplaceTRUE} = \\begin{cases}1 \\quad \\text{ if a home has at least one fireplace}\\\\ 0\\quad \\text{ if a home does not have a fireplace} \\end{cases}\\] In fact, R creates this indicator for you when you put a categorical variable as an X variable in the model. lm.home &lt;- lm(Price ~ AnyFireplace, data = homes) tidy(lm.home) ## # A tibble: 2 x 5 ## term estimate std.error statistic p.value ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 (Intercept) 174653. 3419. 51.1 0. ## 2 AnyFireplaceTRUE 65261. 4522. 14.4 1.17e-44 Our “best fitting line” is \\[ \\hbox{Predicted Price} = 174653.35 + 65260.61 \\times 1_{AnyFireplaceTRUE} \\] What does this mean? Let’s think about two types of homes: a home with one or more fireplaces and a home without a fireplace. Let’s write out the equations for those two types of homes. Home with fireplace: \\[ \\hbox{Predicted Price} = 174653.35 + 65260.61 \\times 1 = \\$ 239,914 \\] 174653.35 + 65260.61*1 ## [1] 239914 Home without fireplace: \\[ \\hbox{Predicted Price} = 174653.35 + 65260.61 \\times 0 = \\$ 174,653.35 \\] The difference between these predicted prices is $65,260.61. So is this how much a fireplace is worth? If I installed a fireplace in my house, should the value of my house go up $65,260? No, because we are not making causal statements based on observational data. What could be confounding this relationship? What third variable may be related to both the price and whether or not a house has a fireplace? Let’s look at the size of the house. Is price related to the area of living space (square footage)? homes %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = Living.Area, y = Price)) + geom_point(color = &#39;steelblue&#39;) + theme_minimal() Is the presence of a fireplace related to area of living space? homes %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = AnyFireplace, y = Living.Area)) + geom_boxplot() + theme_minimal() We see that the amount of living area differs between homes with fireplaces and homes without fireplaces. Thus, Living Area could confound the relationship between AnyFireplace and Price because it is related to both variables. Let’s put Living Area in the model along with AnyFireplace to account for it (to control/adjust for it). lm.home2 &lt;- lm(Price ~ AnyFireplace + Living.Area, data = homes) tidy(lm.home2) ## # A tibble: 3 x 5 ## term estimate std.error statistic p.value ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 (Intercept) 13599. 4992. 2.72 6.51e- 3 ## 2 AnyFireplaceTRUE 5567. 3717. 1.50 1.34e- 1 ## 3 Living.Area 111. 2.97 37.5 2.20e-225 Our “best fitting line” is \\[ \\hbox{Predicted Price} = 13599.16 + 5567.37 \\times 1_{AnyFireplaceTRUE} + 111.21 \\times \\hbox{Living.Area} \\] What does this mean? Let’s think about two types of homes: a home with one or more fireplaces and a home without a fireplace. Home with fireplace: \\[ \\begin{align*} \\hbox{Predicted Price} &amp;= 13599.16 + 5567.37 \\times 1 + 111.21 \\times \\hbox{Living.Area} \\\\ &amp;= \\$19,166.53 + \\$111.21 \\times \\hbox{Living.Area} \\end{align*} \\] 13599.16 + 5567.37*1 ## [1] 19166.53 Home without fireplace: \\[ \\begin{align*} \\hbox{Predicted Price} &amp;= 13599.16 + 5567.37 \\times 0 + 111.21 \\times \\hbox{Living.Area} \\\\ &amp;= \\$13,599.16 + \\$111.21 \\times \\hbox{Living.Area} \\end{align*} \\] If we keep Living.Area constant by considering two equally sized homes, then we’d expect the home with the fireplace to be worth $5567.37 more than a home without a fireplace. We see this by taking the difference between the two equations: \\[ \\hbox{Predicted Price (with Fireplace)} - \\hbox{Predicted Price (without Fireplace)} \\] \\[ \\begin{align*} \\,&amp;= (\\$19,166.53 + \\$111.21 \\times \\hbox{Living.Area}) - ( \\$13599.16 + \\$111.21 \\times \\hbox{Living.Area}) \\,&amp;= \\$19,166.53 - \\$13,599.16 = \\$5567.37 \\end{align*} \\] The difference between the intercepts is 5567.37. Note this was the estimated coefficient for AnyFireplaceTRUE. So the $5567.37 is the increase in the predicted or average Price associated with a 1 unit change in AnyFireplace (TRUE or FALSE), keeping all other variables (Living.Area) constant. Similarly, we could reason that $111.21 is the increase in the predicted or average Price associated with a 1 square footage increase in Living.Area, keeping all other variables (AnyFireplace) constant. Let’s look back at the relationship between Living.Area and Price and color the scatterplot by AnyFireplace. So we are now looking at three variables at a time. The above model with AnyFireplace and Living.Area results in two lines, with different intercepts but the same slope (parallel lines). homes %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = Living.Area, y = Price, color = AnyFireplace)) + geom_point() + theme_minimal() Let’s try and fit two separate lines to these two groups of homes, home with any fireplaces and home with no fireplaces. Do these lines have the same intercepts? Same slopes? homes %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = Living.Area, y = Price, color = AnyFireplace)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = &#39;lm&#39;, se = FALSE) + theme_minimal() In this case, it look as though having a fireplace in your house slightly changes the relationship between Living.Area and Price. In fact, having a fireplace in your house, the increase in your price for every 1 square foot is greater than that for homes without fireplaces (slopes are different). 3.9.2 Interaction Variables We can actually allow for different slopes within one regression model, rather than fitting two separate models. If we add a variable in the model as is, it changes the intercept. We can achieve different slopes by allowing a variable \\(x_1\\) to affect the slope for another variable \\(x_2\\). That is, \\(x_1\\) impacts the effect of \\(x_2\\) on the outcome \\(y\\). (Fireplace presence impacts the effect of living area on house price.) \\[b_2 = a + bx_1\\] This is called effect modification (when one variable can modify the effect of another variable on the outcome). A model with effect modification looks like: \\[\\hat{y} = b_0 + b_1x_{1} + b_2x_{2}= b_0 + b_1x_{1} + (a+bx_1)x_{2}= b_0 + b_1x_{1} +ax_2+bx_1x_{2}\\] The model above has an interaction term, which is the product of two variables. Here we have \\(x_1*x_2\\). Let’s build an effect modification model for our housing data. Let’s include an interaction term between AnyFireplace and Living.Area to allow for different slopes. lm.home3 &lt;- lm(Price ~ AnyFireplace*Living.Area, data = homes) tidy(lm.home3) ## # A tibble: 4 x 5 ## term estimate std.error statistic p.value ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 (Intercept) 40901. 8235. 4.97 7.47e- 7 ## 2 AnyFireplaceTRUE -37610. 11025. -3.41 6.61e- 4 ## 3 Living.Area 92.4 5.41 17.1 1.84e-60 ## 4 AnyFireplaceTRUE:Living.Area 26.9 6.46 4.16 3.38e- 5 What does this mean? Let’s think about two types of homes: a home with one or more fireplaces and a home without a fireplace. Home with fireplace: \\[ {\\small \\begin{align*} \\hbox{Predicted Price} &amp;= 40901.29 + -37610.41 \\times 1 + 92.36391 \\times \\hbox{Living.Area} + 26.85 \\times \\hbox{Living.Area} \\times 1 \\\\ &amp; = \\$3,290.88 + \\$119.21 \\times \\hbox{Living.Area} \\end{align*} } \\] 40901.29 + -37610.41*1 ## [1] 3290.88 92.36391 + 26.85*1 ## [1] 119.2139 Home without fireplace: \\[ {\\small \\begin{align*} \\hbox{Predicted Price} &amp;= 40901.29 + -37610.41 \\times 0 + 92.36391 \\times \\hbox{Living.Area} + 26.85 \\times \\hbox{Living.Area} \\times 0 \\\\ &amp;= \\$40,901.29 + \\$92.36 \\times \\hbox{Living.Area} \\end{align*} } \\] We see a different slope and different intercepts for these two groups. 3.9.3 Causation We alluded earlier that multiple linear regression could provide estimates of causal effects in the right circumstances. What are those circumstances? When we include all confounding variables. This entails being specific about what a confounding variable is. A confounder is a common cause of both the causal variable of interest and the outcome. (e.g. Living area could be a confounder of fireplace presence and house price.) We also alluded earlier that we should not just throw every variable we have into a multiple regression model. Why? Imagine a scenario for understanding how smoking affects lung cancer development. It is very important to consider whether a variable is a mediator of the relationship between the cause and the outcome. A mediator in this example could be tar. Suppose that smoking only affects lung cancer risk by creating tar on the lungs. If we adjust for tar (by holding it constant), then we also effectively hold smoking constant too! If smoking is held constant, then we cannot estimate its effect on cancer risk because it is not varying! Wait - we could never possibly know of or measure all confounding variables, could we!? This is true, but that doesn’t mean that our endeavor to understand causation is fruitless. As long as we can describe the relationship between known confounders as precisely as possible, we have a starting ground for moving forward. We collect data, analyze how well our model predicts that data, and collect more data based on that, perhaps measuring more potential confounders as our scientific knowledge grows. We can also conduct sensitivity analyses by asking: how strongly must a confounder affect the variable of causal interest and the outcome to completely negate or reverse the association we see? Such endeavors and more are the subject of the field of causal inference. Reminder: If you want a “gentle” but mathematical introduction to Causal Inference, I’d suggest reading “Causal Inference in Statistics: A Primer” by Judea Pearl, Madelyn Glymour, Nicholas P. Jewell). Fun Fact: Nicholas Jewell was Prof. Heggeseth’s PhD advisor! 3.9.4 Conditions for Multiple Linear Regression In order for a multiple linear regression model to make sense, Relationships between each quantitative \\(X\\)’s and \\(Y\\) are straight enough (check scatterplots and residual plot) About equal spread of residuals across fitted values (check residual plot) No extreme outliers (points far away in X’s can have leverage to change the line) 3.9.5 Is the Difference Real?

We don’t have data for everyone in our population (we don’t have a census). Depending on who ends up in our sample, the relationship/difference/estimate may change a bit. We want to know how much the relationship/difference/estimate may change based on sampling variation. Let’s treat our sample (of size \\(n\\)) as our ‘fake’ population (since we don’t have the full population). Randomly sample from our sample (with replacement) a new sample of size \\(n\\) Calculate the least squares regression line.

["logistic-regression.html", "3.10 Logistic Regression", " 3.10 Logistic Regression If you are interested in predicting a binary categorical variable (only 2 possible outcomes), the standard linear regression models don’t apply. If you let the two outcomes be 0 and 1, you’ll never get a straight line relationship with an x variable. Throughout this section, we will refer to one outcome as ‘success’ (denoted 1) and ‘failure’ (denoted 0). Depending on the context of the data, the success could be a negative thing such as ‘heart attack’ or ‘20 year mortality’. We will let \\(\\pi\\) be the chance of success and \\(1-\\pi\\) be the chance of failure. We want to build a model to explain why the chance of success may be higher for one group of people in comparison to another. 3.10.1 Logistic and Logit The logistic function is an S shaped curve (sigmoid curve). For our purposes, the function will take the form \\[f(x) = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{b_0 +b_1x}}\\] For any real value x, f(x) will be a value between 0 and 1. This is perfect for us since probabilities/chances should also be between 0 and 1. In fact, we’ll let the chance of failure, \\(1-\\pi\\), be modeled by this function. \\[1-\\pi = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{b_0 +b_1x}}\\] With a bit of algebra and rearranging terms, we can write this in terms of \\(\\pi\\), the chance of success. \\[\\pi = \\frac{e^{b_0 +b_1x}}{1 + e^{b_0 +b_1x}}\\] Let’s define one more term. The odds of success is the ratio of the probability of success to the probability of failure, \\(\\pi/(1-\\pi)\\). With a bit more algebra and rearranging terms, we can write the above model in terms of a regression model, \\[\\log\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{1-\\pi}\\right) = b_0 +b_1x\\] On the left hand side, we have the natural log of the odds, called the logit function. On the right hand side, we have an equation for a line. This is a simple logistic regression model. Just like a linear regression model, we can extend this model to a multiple logistic regression model by adding additional x variables, \\[\\log\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{1-\\pi}\\right) = b_0 +b_1x_1+b_2x_2+b_3x_3+\\cdots +b_kx_k\\] 3.10.2 Fitting the Model Based on observed data that includes responses (1 for success, 0 for failure) and predictor variables, we need to find the slope coefficients, \\(b_0\\),…,\\(b_k\\) that best fits the data. The way we do this is through a technique called maximum likelihood estimation. We will not discuss the details in this class; we’ll save this for an upper level stats class. In R, we do this with a general linear model function, glm(). For a data set, let’s go back in history to January 28, 1986. On this day, the Challenger U.S. space shuttle took off and exploded about minute after the launch. After the fact, scientists ruled that the disaster was due to o-ring seal failure. Let’s look at experimental data on the o-rings prior to the fateful day. require(vcd) data(SpaceShuttle) SpaceShuttle %&gt;% filter(!is.na(Fail)) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = factor(Fail), y = Temperature) )+ geom_boxplot() + theme_minimal() SpaceShuttle %&gt;% filter(!is.na(Fail)) %&gt;% group_by(Temperature) %&gt;% summarise(PercentFail = mean(Fail == &#39;yes&#39;)) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = Temperature, y = PercentFail)) + geom_point() + theme_minimal() What is the plot above telling us about the relationship between chance of o-ring failure and temperature? Let’s fit a simple logistic regression model to predict the chance of o-ring failure based on the temperature using the experimental data. model.glm &lt;- glm(Fail ~ Temperature, data = SpaceShuttle, family = binomial) summary(model.glm) ## ## Call: ## glm(formula = Fail ~ Temperature, family = binomial, data = SpaceShuttle) ## ## Deviance Residuals: ## Min 1Q Median 3Q Max ## -1.0611 -0.7613 -0.3783 0.4524 2.2175 ## ## Coefficients: ## Estimate Std.

What do they mean? tidy(model.glm) ## # A tibble: 2 x 5 ## term estimate std.error statistic p.value ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 (Intercept) 15.0 7.38 2.04 0.0415 ## 2 Temperature -0.232 0.108 -2.14 0.0320 If you want to get a sense of what the number -0.232 means, we need to do a bit of algebra. Our estimated model is \\[\\log\\left(\\frac{\\hat{\\pi}}{1-\\hat{\\pi}}\\right) = b_0 +b_1x\\] where \\(b_0 = 15\\) and \\(b_1 = -0.232\\). If we imagine increasing x by 1, then we get a different set of predicted probabilities of success, \\(\\hat{\\pi}^*\\), \\[\\log\\left(\\frac{\\hat{\\pi}^*}{1-\\hat{\\pi}^*}\\right) = b_0 +b_1(x+1)\\] Let’s find the difference between these two equations, \\[\\log\\left(\\frac{\\hat{\\pi}^*}{1-\\hat{\\pi}^*}\\right) - \\log\\left(\\frac{\\hat{\\pi}}{1-\\hat{\\pi}}\\right) = b_0 +b_1(x+1) - (b_0 +b_1x)\\] and simplify the right hand side, \\[\\log\\left(\\frac{\\hat{\\pi}^*}{1-\\hat{\\pi}^*}\\right) - \\log\\left(\\frac{\\hat{\\pi}}{1-\\hat{\\pi}}\\right) = b_1\\] and then simplify the left hand side, \\[\\log\\left( \\frac{\\hat{\\pi}^*/(1-\\hat{\\pi}^*)}{\\hat{\\pi}/(1-\\hat{\\pi})}\\right) = b_1\\] Let’s exponentiate both sides, \\[\\left( \\frac{\\hat{\\pi}^*/(1-\\hat{\\pi}^*)}{\\hat{\\pi}/(1-\\hat{\\pi})}\\right) = e^{b_1}\\] We find that \\(e^{b_1} = e^{-0.232} = 0.793\\) is the odds ratio based on increasing x by 1 unit (it is a ratio of odds). If a ratio is greater than 1, that means that the denominator is less than the numerator or numerator is greater than denominator. If a ratio is less than 1, that means that the denominator is greater than the numerator or numerator is less than denominator. If the ratio is equal to one, the numerator equals the denominator (odds are equal). In this case, we have a ratio &lt; 1 which means that the estimated odds of o-ring failure is lower for increased temperatures (in particular by increasing by 1 degree). This makes sense since we saw that the chance of o-ring failure decrease with warmer temperatures. 3.10.4 Prediction On January 28, 1986, the temperature was 26 F degrees. Let’s predict the chance of “success,” which is a failure of o-rings in our data context, at that temperature. predict(model.glm, newdata = data.frame(Temperature = 26), type = &#39;response&#39;) ## 1 ## 0.9998774 They didn’t have any experimental data testing o-rings at this low of temperatures, but even based on the data collected, they predict the chance of failure to be nearly 100% (near certainty).

## Acknowledgments

These notes would not be possible without the **bookdown package** and the many open-course R packages used throughout the text. I thank the developers of these packages for making this work possible. 

This structure of this books is strongly influenced by the [bookdown text](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown) written by Yihui Xie.
